Broadly speaking, these policy tools are monetary policy, implemented by a country's central bank, and fiscal policy implemented by the government when it makes expenditure and taxation decisions. We extend our exposition of traditional monetary policy to explain the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing, as well as the essential factors contributing to the financial crisis which necessitated this unconventional monetary policy. We then move onto the interactions between economies as captured in their respective balance of payment accounts and exchange rate movements.
