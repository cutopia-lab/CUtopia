The combined technologies are greatly needed in large-scale environmental monitoring and Smart Cities developments. Another half of the course introduces the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and other indoor positioning technologies. It covers the basic principles, advanced techniques as well as their applications in Earth System Sciences and urban management.
