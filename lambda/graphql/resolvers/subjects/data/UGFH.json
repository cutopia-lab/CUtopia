Students will be engaged in a direct dialogue with literary writers, philosophers and social reformers who address three fundamental questions: What makes a \"good\" life for me? What makes a \"good\" society for everyone? How do I make possible such a \"good\" life and \"good\" society?Students are expected to read, discuss, and write about a wide range of texts extracted from influential classics in the humanities East and West. They will be encouraged to discover their own answers to the three questions by considering views and arguments expressed in the texts, and by exploring how far and in what ways such views and arguments may hold true for the contemporary world. Emphasis will be placed on students\u2019 capacity to respond critically to the selected texts in oral and written presentations, in the form of class or online discussions, short essays and term paper. Class size will be kept small to maximize discussions and to facilitate intensive guidance on academic writing.The content of this course is identical to that of \u201cIn Dialogue with Humanity\u201d (UGFH1000).
