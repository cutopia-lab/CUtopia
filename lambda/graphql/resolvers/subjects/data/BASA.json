The first part is focused on the application of the philosophy of science to behavioral research in business. Basic concepts such as explanation, scientific laws, and theory are introduced and discussed.

The course covers selected advanced topics associated with the behavioral research process. In particular, students will learn how to apply various types of research design and statistical methods, and how to interpret the results. Sample topics include among others experimental design, measurement theory, cross-cultural research, significance tests and statistical power, interaction and moderating effects, multi-level analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modeling.
