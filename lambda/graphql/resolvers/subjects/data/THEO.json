The study of film from serious academic theological perspectives, however, was scarce until the mid 1990s. In this course, we explore a number of approaches by which the theological study of film can take place. These include, for example, the study of explicit representation of religious materials, the 'uncovering' of implicit religious motifs, the use of film as resource for theological reflection and construction. In particular, we shall consider how cinematic representations of certain important theological motifs may enrich conventional religious understanding.

They will also be required to continue the discussion on the eLearning platform (Blackboard) which constitutes one of their homework assignments.\r\u00a0\u00a01. Land Use in Hong Kong; and, Land in the Hebrew Bible: The dialogue will focus on issues related to sustainability, conservation, development, environmental justice, and theologies of territory in the Hebrew Bible.\r\u00a0\u00a02. Poverty and Justice in Hong Kong; and, Church and the Struggle for Social Justice: The dialogue will focus on (a) the different ways (social scientific and theological) of describing, categorizing, explaining, and interpreting the phenomenon of poverty in Hong Kong; (b) how can the church build a movement of Christians committed to tackling poverty in Hong Kong?\r\u00a0\u00a03. Sex, Marriage and Family in Hong Kong; and, En-Gendering Theology: LGBT issues in Hong Kong will be critically discussed. Different ways of Christian responses will be examined.\r\u00a0\u00a04.

Beijing\u2019s policy toward HK and the local reactions in the midst of socio-economic integration in the recent decade will be the focus. This changing phenomenon will be critically engaged with various theological perspectives of church-state relations.\r\u00a0\u00a05. Rule of Law in Hong Kong; and Rule of Law and Christian Traditions: \u201cIs Hong Kong\u2019s rule of law under threat?\u201d \u201cHow is the rule of law to be understood, and understood in the local context?\u201d \u201cHow shall we understand the biblical foundations for the rule of law in the Western world?\u201d \u201cHow shall Christian communities respond to the concerned local debates?\u201d These questions will form the focal concern of the dialogue.\r\u00a0\u00a06. Selected issues in Social Policy; and Christian Vision of a Good Society: one concrete issue regarding local social policy on housing, labor, social welfare, medical and health care, education, or social security, etc. will be selected for the dialogue.
