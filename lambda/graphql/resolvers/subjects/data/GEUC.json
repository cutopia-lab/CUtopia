With \u201cdesign thinking\u201d or by \u201cthinking as a designer\u201d, students can begin to understand how our world has come to its current form through intended and unintended design. Knowing that the only thing that is not designed, is nature, humans need to learn where to draw the line. By acquiring a designer\u2019s mindset in looking at the world, each person can do one\u2019s part to be a responsible and conscious prosumer of design. This includes utilizing eco-friendly artifacts and designing one\u2019s learning, career and life experience on this planet in a responsible way.\r", "outcome": "On completion of the module, students are expected to be able to: Understand the background that gives rise to the experience economy, network society, and design thinking movement; Understand what \u201cdesign thinking\u201d or \u201cthinking as a designer\u201d means and be able to participate in a design process; Utilize role playing, prototyping and visualization aids to frame and solve problems in a group setting; and Apply design thinking in one\u2019s life to become a modern day \u201ceducated person\u201d.Students will achieve the following desirable learning outcomes of the College General Education Programme: describe connections and integrate knowledge across fields; demonstrate the ability to think independently and innovatively; cultivate comprehensive views to appreciate different cultures; and develop leadership skills, and be able to collaborate and communicate effectively in teamwork.", "syllabus": "1.

It is not confined to the technical training of political and policy analysts, but broadened to the liberal education of citizens who have the knowledge, attitudes and competence to participate in public affairs. The purpose of the course is to raise the awareness of students towards social issues, nurture their ability to identify and analyse the pivotal aspects of the issues, and most importantly, encourage the students to form their own opinions and to suggest solutions. In line with this purpose, the course is issue-oriented, with controversial issues cutting across the discussions and reflections. Apart from classroom teaching and discussion, there will also be field trips to government agencies as well as non-government organizations, in which students will have opportunities to directly exchange ideas and opinions with government officials, community leaders and ordinary people.", "outcome": "This course will furnish the students with the following capacities and skills: Throughout the course the students are expected to master the basic concepts in political analysis and be able to apply them to analyse real-world problems. More specifically, the students are expected to develop some basic knowledge as to the different features of civil society, social movement and governance. By taking this course, the students are expected to be familiar with a wide range of practical problems besting the ordinary citizens in Hong Kong and the Mainland China. The students are encouraged to consider and observe the ways in which civil society can help to tackle and resolve these problems, and whether too much hope is placed on civil society. In recent years the places like Hong Kong, Mainland China and Asia in general has been marked by the rise of social movements and new social movements. By taking this course, the students are expected to develop the skills to analyse the rationale behind the social movements and their impact on governance. Perhaps more importantly, the students are expected to have the opportunity and ability to reflect on the \u2018optimal\u2019 relationships between government, private corporations and the social activists of a new generation.  This course is intended to develop the students into active and considerate citizens. In order to become good citizens, they must master generic skills in terms of articulating and communicating complicated ideas and analytical results effectively in both verbal and written formats. These skills are unlikely to emerge automatically. They have to be deliberately nurtured. In this course, through face-to-face interaction with social participants, and a round of presentation and discussion exercises, the students are offered a well-organised setting where their analytical and communicating skills can burgeon.Students will achieve the following desirable learning outcomes of the College General Education Programme: understand the College motto and develop positive attitudes and values; recognize the common concerns of the contemporary world; demonstrate social enterprisingness in protecting the environment and serving the community; and demonstrate the ability to think independently and innovatively.", "syllabus": "Lecture Plan\u00a0\u00a0Week One (2 Hours).
