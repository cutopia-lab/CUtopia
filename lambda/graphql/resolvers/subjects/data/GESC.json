Some cities continue to prosper while others experience declining. How individuals and urban communities can survive and even prosper demands a good understanding of the urban systems. This course will be devoted to the investigation of the growth dynamics of cities, their economic, social and environmental problems and the ways to develop sustainable cities. Many daily life examples of Hong Kong and other cities in China and western countries will be used to illustrate various urban contradictions and problems. After being equipped with the knowledge of various urban issues and problems, students are expected to contribute their knowledge to the urban communities by participating well planned service learning projects in this course and then further enhance their ability to learn effectively through service. After taking this course, students will be well-prepared for challenges in world cities such as Hong Kong and equipped with the knowledge and the vision to become a responsible and concerned urban resident with a passion of caring for people and communities.\r", "outcome": "    GESC2131_outcomes     Cities are important places for living, studying, working and contributing to the society.

Based mainly on, but not limited to, anthropological perspective, this course will discuss how mass media is not just part of our culture and cultural products; but a very important part and an everyday context for the making of culture. This course will examine the processes of mass media production, circulation and consumption to address the following issues: 1) how mass media affect the representation and reproduction of different cultures and societies, 2) how mass media representations contribute to national and transnational identities, 3) how both governmental and market forces create and restrict possibilities of mass media representations, and 4) how technological development affects the relationships among mass media, culture and society. Through investigating the relationship between mass media, society and culture, this course aims at not only acquiring basic idea about anthropology and mass media studies but, more importantly, on reflective and critical thinking regarding who we are and cultural differences in the society we live. To encourage learning through experience - in the field -, not just classroom interactions, this course will include two fieldtrips. One of the trips will focus on the production of mass media. The class will visit and interview mass media producers - music studios, editors of popular magazines, website managers, etc. - at there work sites to learn about the concerns and conditions of mass media production. The other one will focus on the distribution and consumption of mass media. The class will visit a public space where vigorous commercial activities constantly taking place - for example, the Times Square Open Piazza, to observe and investigate what sorts of mass media are presented, how they, together with people, buildings, etc., made of the space, and also how various people passed by engage in different form of mass mediation.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "2141", "title": "Selective Topics in Business", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "2.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Field Studies/Field-tripLecture", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Shaw College", "requirements": "For Shaw College students only.

However, student who have taken GESC2320 can take SOCI3208 and SOCI2218[3222].", "description": "Gender is a pivotal aspect of family relationships. The family is a domain where unequal gender relationships between men and women are systematically created and reproduced. As a social institution, the family, through its distribution of resources, division of labour, and perceptions about gender identity, reinforces a hierarchical relationship between men and women in which men are privileged. On the one hand, the family is an important interactive arena for examining how people produce and do gender, and how gender strategies are created in everyday life. On the other hand, gender is a tool for dissecting the structure of family, its processes, and the outcomes of interactions between its members. This course aims to investigate the complex links between gender and family from a global perspective. It highlights cultural and national similarities and differences in gender and family relationships, the diversities in state responses to the emerging challenges on gender and family relationships globally, and the rapid development of a globalized discourse of gender equality that is based on calls for universal human rights, on blurring the public and private divide and on challenging the boundaries between family and society.\r", "outcome": "Students in this course should study and demonstrate understanding of the interconnection between gender and family in shaping individual life chances, the distribution of resources and power, and the division of roles between the two sexes.\u00a0 Students are also expected to develop a global view on differences and similarities between gender and family across cultures and societies, as well as the diversities in state responses to the emerging challenges on gender and family relationships globally. More generally, students should acquire a set of analytical skills and methods to critically reflect on the concept of gender in contributing to our understanding of societies and cultures; to understand the diversified family formation process, family patterns and practices, the role of evidence and research methods in cross cultural comparative analysis; the role of transferable skills and insights beyond national and cultural boundaries, and the development of global values of human rights and equality for reflecting on the social reality of own society and individual biography, as well as one\u2019s value positions and life choices.", "syllabus": "The major concepts to be covered include: The conceptual distinctions between sex and gender; the multicultural understanding of family, and the concept of globalization. The major topics to be covered include: 1) the conceptual interconnection between gender and family; 2) cultural and national diversities in understanding of family, its structure and dynamics; 3) the intersection between the public and the private domain as evidenced by close links between unpaid housework and paid employment, the more intricate interrelations between paid household work provided by foreign domestic helper and the family, the tension between parenting and work, and ;4) the globalized movement towards gender equality as illustrated by global networks and advocacy against domestic violence and sexual harassment, and the global call for family policies that promote gender equality and gender mainstreaming.", "required_readings": "Topic 1: The intersection between gender and familyColtrane, Scott (2008).
