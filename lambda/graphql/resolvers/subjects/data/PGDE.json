They comprise an indispensable part of the school curriculum and often a significant part of students\u2019 memories of school life. As the Hong Kong school curriculum reforms, greater significance is focused on extra-curricular, academic, cross-curricular, integrated curricular and life-wide learning activities. Organizing student activities is an integral duty of educators nowadays, and it is a pre-requisite that they know how to design and implement student activities that are both safe and meaningful. This course aims to equip students with knowledge and skills required in design and implementation of student activities. The ultimate goal is to enhance both the processes and outcomes of student activities in the school curriculum and meet educational expectations on student learning through activities. Another aim is to heighten students\u2019 awareness of safety and insurance issues in risk assessment through class activities.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.

Shifting expectations require teachers to have a firm understanding of how schools operate and how reforms affect their roles both in and outside of the classroom.

This course is designed to help teachers to understand and shape their roles in a reform environment. In other words it aims to help teachers to become leaders of their own professionalism. It does this in two ways, first it helps teachers understand life in schools undergoing reform and the effect this can have on their professional life. Topics covered in this area include organizational culture, micropolitics, organizational behaviour and teacher leadership. The second thrust aims to nurture teacher awareness of their own professional growth and how they can maximize the latest opportunities available in this area.

The social and policy environment after 1997 is exerting a great impact on education. Part of this impact is that teachers risk facing litigations or their rights being evaded if they are not careful and guarded enough in their daily school lives. In order to reduce these risks, this module will introduce some of the most significant legal issues that arise in primary and secondary schools and their implications for teachers. The module will: i) explore evolving legal standards on a variety of issues including employment, school safety, student discipline, student well-being, infringement of copyright, free speech, services for students with special education needs and non-Chinese learners, sexual harassment, and violence and bullying; ii) examine educational, political, ethical, and administrative questions that legal issues often generate; iii) draw on real cases and legal/policy dilemmas that teachers are facing; and iv) provide teachers with knowledge and skills they need to make sound decisions, advance important educational objectives, and minimize legal problems.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.

Unfortunately, this is exactly the reason why adults, including parents and teachers, often avoid frank discussions about sexuality with young people. In short, adults themselves are trapped in various contradictions and myths about sex in society, which often renders them ineffective in communicating their views and values to youth, providing high-quality sexuality education, and proactively setting effective school policies pertaining to sexuality-related behaviors.This course discusses various issues related to sexuality, particularly those that are relevant to young people. In-service and pre-service teachers will directly confront and analyze related values, identify common confusions and myths associated with youth sexuality, and examine how their own values might influence the approach they take to providing youth with education related to sexuality. Special emphasis will be given to topics that have direct relevance to adolescents\u2019 sexual health and well-being, but are not typically covered in formal sexuality education curricula. Thus, as opposed to providing teaching methods or ready-to-use teaching materials for classroom demonstration, the primary aims are to raise educators\u2019 awareness of these issues and to help them to proactively clarify their own values in advance of conversations with students. In doing so, they can avoid confusion, misinformation, or unsupportive responses when interacting with youth. By having clear concepts and values regarding sexuality, they can communicate accurate information, provide affirming and supportive guidance to students and advocate for evidence-based school policies in a way that best fits their own instructional contexts.Grade Descriptor: A - Outstanding performance on all learning outcomesB - High performance on some learning outcomesC - Good performance on some learning outcomesD - Satisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomesF - Unsatisfactory performance on the majority of learning outcomes, or failure to meet specified assessment requirements(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.
