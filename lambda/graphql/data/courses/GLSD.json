This course aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to global politics, focusing in particular on its origins and historical evolution, its key concepts, major theoretical frameworks, main actors and institutions, the global architecture of power, and its dynamic nature in the process of globalization. It aims to offer students with the basic knowledge and analytical tools for making sense of current issues in global politics. It adopts a multi-disciplinary approach that integrates theoretical issues with regional case studies. The course will first offer a general survey of the key concepts and major theoretical perspectives in the study of Global Politics (Liberalism, Realism, Social Constructivism and Marxist theory, etc.). It then proceeds to cover selected topics of global politics in the areas of War and Peace and the Clash of Civilization. It focuses on how world politics is transformed by globalization, with a particular focus on its impacts on issues concerning the identity and national pride, balance of power, peace and conflicts, borders and security, etc. Finally, the course will be concluded with the discussion of latest trends of global governance, with a particular focus on the emergency of international and regional organizations. Relevant real world examples and case studies will be adopted to illustrate the big ideas and key concepts of global politics.This course intends to promote students\u2019 appreciation of the role of \u2018power\u2019, \u2018security\u2019 and \u2018justice\u2019 in shaping the global political order nowadays. Students will gain deeper insights into not only latest developments in global political affairs, but also concepts and theories useful for further studies in politics, international relations, and global political economy.
