It begins with culture-bound syndromes that once flourished in the literature of transcultural psychiatry, followed by an extended discussion on the psychotic condition\u2014a fundamental human mental process\u2014and its institutional treatment, and ends with the latest efforts in anthropology to explore the individual mind in society.\u00a0\u00a0 Week 10.

This course introduces students to the study of morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective. Morality and ethics became a distinct area for anthropological inquiry as recently as the beginning of the 21st century. Why this topic is relatively new in anthropology has something to do with the way in which moral differences have been conflated with cultural differences in the history of the discipline. In other words, anthropologists have long presumed that differences between right and wrong, good and bad, are culturally constructed. In recent years, however, this conflation has been questioned and problematized, with reference to the problem of competing moral goods within a single society and the role of the individual in negotiating moral commitments. Having much to say about cultural differences as well as contingent social processes, anthropologists are now in an even better position to contribute to cross-disciplinary conversations about the nature of morality and ethics. By exploring morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective, this course will demonstrate that morality and ethics is by no means an abstract subject best studied by philosophers. Students will be encouraged to see ethics as a part of their everyday lives, and to see the lives of others as shaped by shared human problems such as how to get along with other people, and how to get along with oneself. This course is divided into four major units. It begins with an issue highly relevant to university students: the responsibility individuals carry for their own success and self-fulfillment in capitalist societies. The second unit considers why moral and cultural differences have been conflated, and how different societies have responded to shared human problems in different ways. The third unit explores the relationship between morality and the creation and maintenance of social relationships. Case studies of small communities in different parts of the world will be especially helpful for understanding morality and ethics from a social perspective, as cooperation can be fragile yet so important in small communities. Topics and readings in the last unit offer resources for enriching and expanding our vocabulary of virtues. Students will be invited to conduct research into the mundane things ordinary people do to take care of one another in daily life.\r", "outcome": "\u00a0 1.

What kind of long-term policy do we have? How should the intangible heritage preservation and management be carried out?

Sports are often thought of as trivial, or as unimportant games to amuse young people. But in the wealthiest countries, sports represent huge portions of GDP and are important topics of daily conversation. Almost half the world watched the 2010 football/soccer World Cup. Sports have been compared to religions in their ability to unite people and to inspire fanatical devotion.The academic study of sports is interdisciplinary, with contributions from psychologists, historians, gender studies scholars, sociologists and anthropologists. This course will take an interdisciplinary approach while emphasizing anthropology\u2019s focus on culture, on the experience of participants, and on both symbolic and political-economy aspects of sports. Topics will include Race and Performance, Sports and Rituals, Sports as Moral Education, Gender and Sexuality in Sport, Sports and Nationalism, Globalization of Sport, the Olympics, and Sports Stars and the Media.

Some of the key questions we raise include: What does it mean to be Chinese? What role does culture play in being Chinese, and what constitutes Chinese society? Our emphasis is on the dominant cultural practices of societies around the world that render them \u2018Chinese\u2019. The course will also situate contemporary China historically within the world-system and examine the dramatic transformations it has undergone as a result of the post-Mao reforms beginning in the late-1970s. Because China has become the world\u2019s most dynamic growth-engine since these reforms were launched, the Chinese experience offers itself as a case-study of the benefits as well as challenges thrown up by modern development. Since China has committed to implementing the 2030 development agenda, including Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as clean water, affordable clean energy, and climate action, this course will offer students the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the discourse of sustainability as articulated by the SDGs. But more than that, with specific reference to the experience of the People\u2019s Republic of China in particular, the course will afford students the opportunity to reflect upon the apparent contradictions existing between what is understood to be \u2018development\u2019 on the one hand and \u2018sustainability\u2019 on the other. ", "outcome": " Upon completing this course, students should be able to: \u00a0 - explain why claims about being Chinese and Chineseness can be such a source of contention. - explain why there are similarities as well as differences across different Chinese societies. - historically as well as anthropologically account for the place of contemporary China within the world-system. - critically discuss the major features and social institutions of Maoist and post-Mao China. - discuss the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), their significance in our times, and how \u2018sustainability\u2019 challenges ideas of development in general and Chinese development specifically. - critically evaluate which of the 17 SDGs are realized \u2013 or compromised by - the Chinese development experience. \u00a0", "syllabus": " Core Content \u00a0 1.

Vignettes of Maoist China\u00a0 6. The Anthropology of Post-Reform China 7. Discussing post-reform China in light of the Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) \u00a0 What does it mean to be Chinese? What role does culture play in being Chinese? And what constitutes Chinese society? When Chinese populations elsewhere (e.g. overseas Chinese) lay claim to being Chinese, what are they invoking? On the other hand, when ethnic Chinese Hong Kongers claim that they are not Chinese, for instance, what are they implying? Is being Chinese primarily given by ethnicity, nationality, cultural/civilizational practices, some combination of the above, or all of them?  This line of questioning would suggest that when we invoke \u201cChinese culture and society\u201d, we refer not only to culture and society in China but also beyond, to Chinese societies elsewhere that have emerged as a result of the Chinese diaspora. Yet at the heart of this discussion still lies the question with which we first began: what does it mean to be Chinese? And what binds mainland Chinese societies with those overseas?  Because the shared identity of being Chinese has here been shown to transcend geographical and national boundaries, I would propose that being Chinese pertains more to the evolving practices of culture than it does the more limiting constraints of ethnicity, geography, or nationality. This class therefore examines the constituents of being Chinese, with the emphasis placed on culture as its animating force.  Accordingly, we begin the course by underlining the significance of\u00a0 \u201cculture\u201d to being \u201chuman\u201d and trace out the implications of this proposition. (Topic 1).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Indeed, it is because culture is a cumulative and evolving social phenomenon \u2013 a process - that accounts for the diversity of Chinese societies around the world (e.g. Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan), that there is something identifiably Chinese in each of them, yet something else that differentiates between them. A pluralist cultural view\u00a0\u00a0 of \u201cChinese\u201d - a civilizational view (?) - will thus be taken as we tease out the similarities and differences existing across these societies. (Topics 2 and 3).  After discussing the differences between the Chinese societies of the world, we will turn our attention to examining the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), whose breathtaking economic development over the past forty years is not in question. Because China - and the PRC, specifically - is a political entity that has had a history of antagonistic relations with the West, the course approaches discussion of China by first problematizing it as a political and historical entity, including its Maoist-Socialist past. (Topics 4 and 5). Such historic contextualization of China is felt to be necessary, the pre-requisite for any discussion of contemporary China, not least its post-Mao developments.  This brings us to the many aspects of post-Mao and post-reform China, the last forty years that have come to be associated with China\u2019s famed developmental experience. (Topic 6).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The consequences of Chinese development - especially in the post-Mao era - speak to most, if not all, of the SDGs, which can be understood to refer to sustainability in three realms: economic, social and ecological. Hence, the anthropology of post-reform China (6) will necessarily highlight issues pertaining, for instance, to poverty and hunger alleviation (SDG 1,2), health and well-being (SDG3), gender (SDG 5), inequality\u00a0 (SDG10), energy (SDG7), and urbanization (SDG 11), among others. This is conducive for a discussion about the SDGs with reference to Chinese development and an examination of whether or not, and when, they are consistent.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "required_readings": " \u00a0 Culture and Humanity Goodman, Mary Ellen. 1967. \u201cThe Nature of Culture\u201d.

The remarkable economic emergence of China and Asia more broadly in recent decades has transformed many impoverished and largely agriculturally based societies into the most dynamic region of the contemporary world. China\u2019s burgeoning aspirational middle classes, rapid urbanisation, time-space compression and the shift from command economies to de-regulated markets have had profound effects on people's everyday lives and the diverse cultural practices that have long shaped local livelihoods and community expectations. This course offers an introduction into anthropological approaches to the study of culture, modernity and globalisation in China and Asia more broadly. Relevant themes that have attracted anthropological interest include changing traditions and popular culture, adaptive custom and cosmopolitanism, migration and citizenship, identity politics and social movements as well as distinctive and emergent forms of governance in both collective and self-cultivating forms of expression. Drawing on a rich corpus of social theory and ethnographic research from anthropologists past and present, the course will provide students with conceptual and analytical tools to appreciate adaptive cultural practices in comparative terms, to review and appreciate the key anthropological debates and influential works in the study of modernity, and to introduce students to ethnographic approaches for researching and writing on modernity and contemporary ethnographies of global connection.\r", "outcome": " 1.

This course addresses the ways in which social media and other related interactions in cyberspace have become a central element in the everyday lives of humans across the globe in the 21st Century. Our modern lives are now largely interwoven with digital technologies that have not only changed our own cultures, but also have brought forth new cultural forms through mobile phone technologies, networked \u201csmart\u201d-products, and cultural groupings only possible through digital means. The course approaches the anthropology of these digital cultures through its main themes\u2014the transformation and expansion of social media, social research online, the intermixing of our online and offline lives, critical social issues of online lives, and the question of posthumanism. These themes are addressed explicitly in the course, and are also the subtexts of the different lectures, readings, and project work. Students will learn the techniques of online fieldwork and referencing. They will explore a diverse array of new ethnographies on social media: on gender, political movements, online dating, hacking, and gaming culture. These ethnographies also serve to model online social research and provide examples of methodology and design. The social consequences of cyberspace are addressed in the topics of internet pornography, addiction, surveillance, activism, and social networking. Gender and identity issues are a continuous theme throughout the course, highlighting how online lives accentuate already existing dynamics. Hong Kong connections to these subjects will also be critically discussed, often drawing on topical themes presented on blogs and forums. Students will learn of the philosophical questions of posthumanism and the nature of technologically mediated human culture. This serves as a philosophical ballast to the course allowing students to reflect personally on their own experiences and how technology has and will continue to shape their lives. The role of anthropology in understanding and capturing human culture in this context anchors on the investigation of how technology is possibly making us \u2018more\u2019 human than previous forms of cultural life. \r", "outcome": "\u00a0 \u00a0 After taking this course students will have learnt how to design and perform online fieldwork and manage digital referencing.\u00a0 \u00a0 Students will know of and understand the recent history and development of the internet and key platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, eBay, iTunes, and the ways in which cyberspace has become embedded in the everyday work and social lives of over 2.4 billion internet users.\u00a0 \u00a0 Students will be able to explain and discuss the various debates on the social consequences of online technologies with regard to the tensions between online lives and (so called) real lives, or digital dualism.\u00a0 \u00a0 Students will be able to address and articulate issues of political and philosophical change, activism, addiction, surveillance, the body and visual culture in connection to mobile technologies.\u00a0 \u00a0 Students will know of some philosophical discussions on the nature of humanity in this new epoch.

Whilst being a core topic, this is also part of the weekly project work of the course. Students will start \u00a0\u00a0their digital research from the beginning of the course, by first developing a blog and networking with classmates.  Cultural History of Cyberspace \u2013 How did the world go online? This topic addresses the historical and technological developments that led the world to go online. Its key concern is to highlight how this has altered and affected society, and how quickly online life has become a part of everyday life.  Social Networking Sites \u2013 The rise of web 2.0 and how the internet has become social. How have different SNS emerged, how do they connect, isolate, liberate, and limit social activity? Online Culture is explored via the different uses of various SNS platforms, and their own identities.  Sex and Body Culture in Cyberspace \u2013 Tackles the social consequences of online pornography in different social and cultural circumstances. Body politics, risk, and sexuality online.  Posthumanism \u2013 This is framed in the first week as a key issue and returns as the focus of the last 2 weeks of the course.This topic looks at the impact of cyberspace on our philosophical understanding of our bodies and ourselves. How is technology changing our attitudes to gender, ethnicity, religion, and is it making us more or less human?

Weekly work on blogs relate to class discussions and require students to source and reference. It is addressed as a key topic in Week 1 & Week 9. Social Consequences of online lives as a theme is most strongly represented in the topics of week 5, 6, 8, 10 and 11. As well, because of the salience of this topic it \u00a0relates to other core topics such as 3,4,7, 11, and 12. Posthumanism is a philosophical theme that is introduced in Week 1 and is relevant throughout the course.

What does it mean to be human? Where did we come from? Where are we going? This course investigates long-term evolutionary perspectives on the human species. The basics of evolution and natural selection as scientific theories are clearly set out and examined, and common misconceptions discussed. Evidence for the evolution of mammals and primates is reviewed and discussed, and the common characteristics of these species are highlighted, demonstrating the connections between humans and other forms of life. The course covers what we know about human ancestors and the evolution of modern humans. Students are introduced to the wide range of human adaptations to local conditions across contemporary cultures and the variety of relationships that human populations have with the environment. Students are encouraged to use the knowledge they have acquired to ask: are these relationships always sustainable? Looking to the future: what are our responsibilities both to future generations of humans and towards other species with which we share our world? This course aims to give students an understanding and appreciation of evolutionary perspectives on the place of humans in the world, the variety of contemporary human societies, and a broad perspective on the complexity of the relationship between humans, the environment and other species.\r", "outcome": "In this course students learn about the nature of scientific theories and their development, as well as the use of evidence in evaluating hypotheses. Students are also exposed to the potential for misunderstandings of scientific theory and the distinction between fact and value. Comparative abilities are emphasised through reviewing common features of the life-course of a variety of animals and the influence of animal habitats, with particular focus on closely related primate species.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The history of human evolution is introduced to students, focussing on the emergence of universal capacities such as language, technology, art and culture. Students are encouraged to learn about and appreciate the variety of human cultures and the flexibility of humans in adapting to local environments. A comparative perspective on human culture is encouraged through a focus on the common subsistence needs of all humans, and the variety of practices by which these needs are met.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Students are exposed to a wide perspective on the place of the human species in the world. They are encouraged to exercise long-term evaluations of, and exercise a sense of judgement about the impact and sustainability of human action, both in relation to the environment and other species as well as future generations of the human species. Students are thus encouraged to think about their own place in society.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "syllabus": "Weekly Topics\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction: Orientation and Course Overview\u00a0Week 2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Evolution and Natural Selection 1: History of the Idea\u00a0Week 3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Evolution and Natural Selection 2: Mechanisms, Examples and Some Common Misunderstandings (Teleology and Determinism)\u00a0Week 4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Evolution of Mammals and Primates: History, Defining Characteristics and Current Diversity\u00a0Week 5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Characteristics of Living Primates\u00a0Week 6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 African Apes and Hominid Origins\u00a0Week 7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Human Ancestors\u00a0Week 8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [Mid-term]\u00a0Week 9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Emergency of Modern Humans 1: Debates, Methods of Study and The Use of Evidence\u00a0Week 10\u00a0 The Emergence of Modern Humans 2: Technologies and Art\u00a0Week 11\u00a0 Human Adaptability to Local Conditions\u00a0Week 12\u00a0 Varieties of Human Subsistence\u00a0Week 13\u00a0 Humans and our Environments Today\u00a0Week 14\u00a0 Sustainability and Survival\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "required_readings": "Key Reading Material\u00a0(see below for further reading)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reading material for the topics will be available in the Library and/or provided in the form of handouts in class.

People acquire a special sense of presence, knowledge, and power from the brute fact of their bodies as sentient, sensuous, instinctual, habitual, feeling, and erotic organisms. At the same time, this special presence has made the materiality of the body a contested site for representational practices and politics in which love and emotions have figured centrally. Through an ethnographic focus on cross-cultural studies of love and emotions, this course seeks to juxtapose and reconcile the body's manifold facets as materiality and representation, subject and object. We will address the following questions: What are the culturally differentiating politics and poetics of the seemingly universal emotion of love? What conceptions of the body and personhood do they articulate? How do modern notions of love and desire underscore changing gender relations, sexual identities, and embodied ideals of masculinity and femininity? How do affect and embodiment intersect with the problems of class, race, ethnicity, and nationality?\r", "outcome": "1.

Students will examine systems of meanings and practices that evolved around notions of love, body, and emotions across time and place, and their political significance. In particular, the cross-cultural perspective will demonstrate the intimate associations of these \u2018private emotions and desires\u2019 with social structures such as gender, class, ethnicity, and religion. It examines both the reproductive role of ideologies about love and intimacy in different societies, as well as their transformative potential.\r\u00a0\u00a0The questions that will be raised in class include: Do bodily and emotional experiences of intimacy differ across cultures? What shape the economic and social formations of intimate relationships such as love and friendship? What does it mean to say that romantic love is an ideology? What have our desires got to do with social order? Why are some emotions and desires taboo?

Premised on a social constructivist understanding of gender and sexuality, the course aims to provide a set of tools for students to understand and analyze the norms and frameworks regulating human sexuality through the law. The course further locates the making of gender and sexuality in the law within histories of colonialism and imperialism. Students will learn to evaluate different legislative and judicial responses to issues directly related to sexuality such as consent, rape and adultery, prostitution and human trafficking, violence against women, homosexuality, same-sex and heterosexual marriage etc. They will also learn to examine how legal regulation of gender and sexuality extends into other areas of the law about urban space, inheritance, citizenship, immigration and asylum, as well as the prison system. The course aims at providing students with the critical tools to analyze the cultural and historical constructions that inform \u201claws in the books, laws in the mind, and laws in action.\u201d ", "outcome": "1) Analyze the logic and assumptions law\u2019s relationship to gender, sexuality, class, and ethnicity;\u00a02) Contextualize the meanings of gender and sexuality embedded in juridical processes within a historical and cross-cultural perspective;\u00a03) Understand law as social processes, legal documents as ethnographic artifacts, and legal procedures as techniques of legitimation;\u00a04) Develop skills to critically examine the making of laws, their ways of enforcement, and their impact on people.", "syllabus": "Lecture 1 Introduction \r\u00a0\u00a0Lecture 2 Theorizing Sexuality, Gender, and Power\r\u00a0\u00a0Foucault, Michel. 1984[1979].

Such unique and geographically-defined records of particular groups and their way of life are what UNESCO calls \u201ccultural landscapes\u201d (R\u00f6ssler 2006). Landscapes also reflect and embody intangible beliefs and if we are to understand such \u2018non-material\u2019 meanings we must embrace both Western and non-Western (e.g. Chinese) approaches to their study. Hong Kong\u2019s cultural landscape is overwhelmingly urban and modern in character, embedded within, beyond and beneath the city lie other \u2018hidden\u2019 landscapes reflecting more ancient belief systems and traditional practices such as agrarian and maritime lifeways and their \u2018traditional\u2019 belief systems. Also, Hong Kong has many culturally important \u2018ephemeral\u2019 landscapes, relating to the temporary transformation of spaces, for example during religious festivals, or even the more routine transformations that occur at street eateries (dai pai dong) or markets. This course explores the concept \u201clandscape\u201d, its tangible and intangible dimensions, how they are physically evidenced locally and abroad, and how anthropologists, archaeologists and a myriad of other disciplines approach their study and interpretation. In particular, we will work through a series of local case studies to see what landscape can tell us about the lifeways, economies, politics and beliefs of past and present communities in Hong Kong. By studying cultural landscapes we can also identify what past and present communities, organisations and governments chose to keep and protect and what they let go \u2013 by assessing such processes we can develop an understanding of the underlying socio-political and economic drivers at work through time. In terms of heritage management, therefore, if we wish to militate against the gradual loss of meaning and value in our cultural landscapes, a landscape approach is indicated.\r", "outcome": "After completing this course students will: \r\u00a0\u2022 Understand the origins, development and fundamental ideas underlying the concepts of \u201clandscape\u201d, \u201ccultural landscape\u201d and \u201csocial landscape\u201d and how they are related;\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 In general terms be able to identify and explain the key differences in Western and non-Western (including Chinese) understandings and valuing of landscapes, and then apply and evaluate them in terms of real-life case studies; \u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Recognise that landscape is a powerful concept connecting scholars across multiple disciplines, and an \u2018arena\u2019 where conflicting views, values, and meanings are negotiated by a range of different stakeholders, for example government legislators and curators, \u2018expert\u2019 consultants, and local community groups;\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Appreciate the importance of the \u2018social landscape approach\u2019 as a means of understanding multi-period cultural landscapes in terms of recursive (feedback) interactions between human agency and natural processes; \u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Recognise that cultural landscapes materially reflect human choices and value-judgements across space and through time, and can thus reveal what past and present communities, organisations and governments chose to keep and protect and what they let go, and most importantly why;\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 More fully understand the value of \u2018landscape\u2019, not only in terms of its critical importance to\u2014among others\u2014anthropologists, archaeologists and heritage managers, but also its key role in our day-to-day engagements with and understandings of the world about us as social beings.", "syllabus": "Major Topics\r\u00a0\u2022 Concept, history, use and understanding of \u201clandscape\u201d in Western and non-Western contexts \r\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Landscape as a bridge between disciplines and facilitator of new dialogues \r\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Anthropologies and Archaeologies of Landscape\r\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Legislation and Guidelines for Landscape: from World Heritage to Local Interpretations\r\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Contested Spaces: Landscapes as Arenas for Conflict, Resistance and Negotiation \r\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Historic Urban Landscape: Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Macau\r\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Before the Metropolis: Social Landscapes and Sustainability in Pre-urban Hong Kong\r\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Exploring the Intangible: Hong Kong\u2019s Ephemeral Landscapes \r\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Review: Assessing the Causes, Effects and Future Implications of Hong Kong\u2019s \u2018Landscape-less\u2019 Approach to Heritage Management\r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two 45 minute lectures and one 45 minute tutorial per week for one semester, plus a field trip to explore a cultural landscape in Hong Kong.", "required_readings": "Submissions & academic honesty\r\u00a0As required by the university, from Sept. 2008, students must submit a soft copy of their computer-generated text assignments to VeriGuide at a specified URL.

In North America, the discipline ofanthropology is typically broken into the four subfields of physical or biologicalanthropology, archaeological anthropology, linguistic anthropology and socio-culturalanthropology. Taken together, these four subfields give anthropology a unique, \u201cholistic\u201dperspective on the human experience, stressing the contribution of the biological as well asthe cultural \u2013 \u201cnature\u201d as well as \u201cnurture\u201d - in the formation of the human past and present.Yet, for reasons that will be elaborated, we will primarily be examining the many themes andsub-fields of sociocultural anthropology. This course can be regarded as a generalintroduction to the major currents within sociocultural anthropology.It is not unreasonable to argue that the concerns of sociocultural anthropology can be tracedto the distant past, when questions concerning social life first emerged (i.e. to the AncientGreeks in the West, or to the time of Confucius in China). But we shall begin our discussionof the story of anthropology closer to our time (i.e. the modern period), when the productionof social knowledge started to take on a more systematic and disciplinary guise. So, we willbegin our story of the development of anthropology when the discipline took on elements ofits current disciplinary constitution in the West. In fact, it is the aim of this course to helpstudents see the relevance of anthropological knowledge and analysis for understandingpresent-day realities.While the analytical focus is on the present, the present inevitably calls for an appreciation ofthe past. Analysis in anthropology thus involves the deployment of the conceptual to reflectupon empirical phenomena unfolding across time and space, along varying scales. As weinquire how the present is connected to the past, we are also compelled to ask how the local isrelated to the global. The empirical in turn informs and modifies the conceptual in an everiterativeprocess of knowledge-and-reality-making. In keeping with this, our discussions inthis course will involve a simultaneous focus on:i. Major anthropological concernsii. The contemporary human predicament and how we got here.", "required_readings": "Please refer to the latest course syllabus.", "recommended_readings": "Recommended Reading List/References:\u00a0\u00a0Bohannan, Paul, and Mark Glazer, eds. 1988.

Then, we examine the emergence of ethnic groups in relation to colonization, the rise of modern nation-states, and globalization. In the third part, we focus on the politics of ethnicity. We will also discuss the making, experience and expression of ethnicity in everyday life. Finally, we will reflect on two key issues: conflicts between ethnic groups, and human rights and equality between the minority and the majority peoples.

These two areas of learning will enable you to think about societies past and present and about lives lived within these societies from a new perspective.

Dealing with death, both practically and psychologically, is something that all humans must face.

It looks at death and death ritual in both modern and pre-modern contexts and analyses it socially, psychologically, politically, and culturally.

What is it like to be mentally abnormal or even pathological? Do people in different cultures or societies experience, understand, and treat psychopathology in different ways? This course examines psychological experiences\u2014feelings, perceptions, thoughts, and motivations\u2014from social and cross-cultural perspectives. It sets out to explore the intersection between anthropology, a field that typically turns to the exotic other, and psychology, a field that often takes the universality of mental activities and mechanisms for granted. Specific focus is placed upon how ethnographers, clinicians, and researchers with training in both fields grapple with various mental phenomena and different ways of understanding them. As most of the materials are drawn from psychological anthropology, this course also serves as an eclectic introduction to this subfield, which was once influential in the history of American anthropology.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "5321", "title": "Topics in Anthropology", "career": "Postgraduate -

Starting with an overview of the development of medical knowledge and health care, and the role of society and culture in formulating theories and myths of sickness and healing, the course will examine issues such as culture-bound syndromes and cross-cultural stress and psychiatry; ritual, religious beliefs, and medicine; anthropological perspectives on epidemiology, pharmacology, and doctor-patient relationships; Chinese and Western medical systems; and health and inequality across ethnicity, class and gender. Students are encouraged to critically think about the interaction between biological, environmental and social factors in health and illness, and, as the world become more globalized, the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments, as well as global health. MA students will read the primary literature and will be expected to write a research paper.

By doing so it serves as an eclectic introduction to medical anthropology, a sub-field of anthropology that attends to the above-mentioned issues across socio-cultural contexts. The first half of the course deals with a series of questions that constitutes the heart of the field, including how culture shapes the representations of illness, how healing occurs in a local world, and how to make sense of illness experiences through narratives. The latter half of the course builds on the discussion of these questions and explore three themes that have become influential since the 1990s: social suffering, local biology, and structural violence. In the last two weeks of the course, we\u2019ll examine care\u2014a mundane yet indispensable act\u2014and its impossibility in the context of extreme violence.", "required_readings": "Film: excerpts from The Hole (\u6d1e), directed by Tsai Ming-Liang (\u8521\u660e\u4eae), 1998\u674e\u5b87\u5b99 2006 \u300c\u91ab\u9662\u88e1\u6b98\u5b58\u7684\u4e00\u9ede\u9109\u6101\u300d\u3001\u300c\u761f\u75ab\u7e7c\u7e8c\u8513\u5ef6\u300d\u4eca\u5929\u4e0d\u5beb\u75c5\u6b77 \u53f0\u5317 \u5fc3\u9748\u5de5\u574a\u5433\u660e\u76ca 2015 \u55ae\u8eca\u5931\u7aca\u8a18 \u53f0\u5317 \u9ea5\u7530 (\u7247\u6bb5\u7bc0\u9078)Film: excerpts from The River (\u6cb3\u6d41), directed by Tsai Ming-Liang (\u8521\u660e\u4eae), 1997.Rivers, W.

People acquire a special sense of presence, knowledge, and power from the brute fact of their bodies as sentient, sensuous, instinctual, habitual, feeling, and erotic organisms.

Through an ethnographic focus on cross-cultural studies of love and emotions, this course seeks to juxtapose and reconcile the body's manifold facets as materiality and representation, subject and object. We will address the following questions: What are the culturally differentiating politics and poetics of the seemingly universal emotion of love? What conceptions of the body and personhood do they articulate?

It examines both the reproductive role of ideologies about love and intimacy in different societies, as well as their transformative potential. The questions that will be raised in class include: Do bodily and emotional experiences of intimacy differ across cultures? What shape the economic and social formations of intimate relationships such as love and friendship? What does it mean to say that romantic love is an ideology?

What kind of changes does globalization bring about? Does this process move towards increased diversity or homogeneity, towards inclusion or marginalization, towards enhanced democracy or uncontrolled market dominance? This course focuses first on basic concept and debates about globalization and then looks back at transnational connections in history.

It explores sociolinguistics -how linguistic behaviour is shaped by socio-cultural factors - and also metaphor and the problems of cultural interpretation and translation. It also examines a range of symbols in society, the language not just of words but of clothing, material goods, popular culture and political discourse, to understand how cultural symbols are socially constructed, performed and contested.

It explores the nature and structure of language, the underlying meanings and rules of conversation, the shaping of language by gender and social class, formal language and foul language and what they mean, and language and culture: how the structure of enculturated consciousness is shaped by language. It also examines a range of symbols in society, the language not just of words but of everyday goods and everyday life, popular culture and mass media, political discourse and propaganda, and computers and cyberspace, to understand how cultural symbols are socially constructed, performed, and contested. Language and symbols and their cultural construction and social usage form a central topic of anthropological inquiry; this course will explore and explicate this topic. After taking this course, you will appreciate much more the extraordinary nature of language, and you also will have a better understanding of how arbitrary language and symbols are in their hold over us--you will have learned to \u201csee through symbols.\u201d\r\u00a0\u00a0Readings from books are available in UL Library.

What is gender? How does gender shape our everyday life? What kinds of gender-related practices do we see in different societies? What are anthropological concerns of gender? This course takes a comparative perspective, emphasizing diversity among various societies and cultures, to answer these questions. We will read ethnographies and other anthropological, sociological, and historical works to examine taken-for-granted assumptions regarding gender, and consider whether gender is constructed, i.e. not natural.\u00a0\u00a0After a general introduction of the anthropology of gender, this course starts from exploring gender in different cultures, and amongst the Chinese people in different places and time. By doing so, we wish to expose ourselves to what we may not be familiar with, move ourselves out of our comfort zones, and therefore, urge ourselves to consider alternative perspectives on\u00a0gender. The second part of the course examines the making (awareness, experience, production, and performance) of gender through various institutions and practices including family, education, nation-state, body and sexuality, production, and consumption. The third and concluding section of this course emphasizes the current context of globalization and explores particularly the impacts of migration on gender. We will revisit our initial questions about gender and culture and explore the intersection between gender and other categories of difference.\u00a0\u00a0COURSE REQUIREMENTS\u00a0This course is a graduate seminar and is designed to be a discussion-intensive one.

Such unique and geographically-defined records of particular groups and their way of life are what UNESCO calls \u201ccultural landscapes\u201d (R\u00f6ssler 2006). Landscapes also reflect and embody intangible beliefs and if we are to understand such \u2018non-material\u2019 meanings we must embrace both Western and non-Western (e.g. Chinese) approaches to their study. Hong Kong\u2019s cultural landscape is overwhelmingly urban and modern in character, embedded within, beyond and beneath the city lie other \u2018hidden\u2019 landscapes reflecting more ancient belief systems and traditional practices such as agrarian and maritime lifeways and their \u2018traditional\u2019 belief systems. Also, Hong Kong has many culturally important \u2018ephemeral\u2019 landscapes, relating to the temporary transformation of spaces, for example during religious festivals, or even the more routine transformations that occur at street eateries (dai pai dong) or markets. This course explores the concept \u201clandscape\u201d, its tangible and intangible dimensions, how they are physically evidenced locally and abroad, and how anthropologists, archaeologists and a myriad of other disciplines approach their study and interpretation. In particular, we will work through a series of local case studies to see what landscape can tell us about the lifeways, economies, politics and beliefs of past and present communities in Hong Kong. By studying cultural landscapes we can also identify what past and present communities, organisations and governments chose to keep and protect and what they let go \u2013 by assessing such processes we can develop an understanding of the underlying socio-political and economic drivers at work through time. In terms of heritage management, therefore, if we wish to militate against the gradual loss of meaning and value in our cultural landscapes, a landscape approach is indicated.", "outcome": "After completing this course students will: \r\u00a0\u2022 Clearly understand the origins, development and fundamental ideas underlying the concepts of \u201clandscape\u201d, \u201ccultural landscape\u201d and \u201csocial landscape\u201d and be able to explain how they interrelate;\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Be able to identify and explain the key differences in Western and non-Western (including Chinese) understandings and valuing of landscapes, and then apply and evaluate them in terms of real-life case studies; \u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Recognise the research potential of landscape as a powerful concept connecting scholars across multiple disciplines, and an \u2018arena\u2019 where conflicting views, values, and meanings are negotiated by a range of different stakeholders, for example government legislators and curators, \u2018expert\u2019 consultants, and local community groups;\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Thoroughly grasp the importance of the \u2018social landscape approach\u2019 as a means of understanding cultural landscape creation and development in terms of ongoing recursive (feedback) interactions between human agency and natural processes; \u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Fully appreciate the research-management significance of the fact that cultural landscapes materially reflect human choices and value-judgements across space and through time, and can thus reveal what past and present communities, organisations and governments chose to keep and protect and what they let go, and most importantly why;\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Have a good understanding of the value of \u2018landscape\u2019, not only in terms of its critical importance to\u2014among others\u2014anthropologists, archaeologists and heritage managers, but also its key role in our day-to-day engagements with and understandings of the world about us as social beings.", "syllabus": "Major Topics\r\u00a0\u2022 Concept, history, use and understanding of \u201clandscape\u201d in Western and non-Western contexts \r\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Landscape as a bridge between disciplines and facilitator of new dialogues \r\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Anthropologies and Archaeologies of Landscape\r\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Legislation and Guidelines for Landscape: from World Heritage to Local Interpretations\r\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Contested Spaces: Landscapes as Arenas for Conflict, Resistance and Negotiation \r\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Historic Urban Landscape: Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Macau\r\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Before the Metropolis: Social Landscapes and Sustainability in Pre-urban Hong Kong\r\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Exploring the Intangible: Hong Kong\u2019s Ephemeral Landscapes \r\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Review: Assessing the Causes, Effects and Future Implications of Hong Kong\u2019s \u2018Landscape-less\u2019 Approach to Heritage Management\r\u00a0\u00a0Two 45 minute lectures and one 45 minute tutorial per week for one semester, plus a field trip to explore a cultural landscape in Hong Kong.", "required_readings": "Lecture topics and reading materials \r\u00a0NB: Please ensure that you read texts or websites marked thus **; and as many of the others if you have time.\r\u00a0NB: Each week handouts for the lecture will be uploaded onto Blackboard \r\u00a0\u00a0Lecture 1: Concept, history, use and understanding of landscape in Western and non-Western contexts.\r\u00a0**Antrop, M. 2013.
