How can I balance my own dreams with the wishes of my family? What is the best way to behave ethically while also making money for my company? How can a society address the needs of the majority of its citizens while also protecting the weak and needy? Resolving dilemmas often involves making choices between different options or courses of action, or resolving differences between competing interests and priorities. In this course, we will explore ways of thinking about dilemmas, drawing on the insights of classical and modern thinkers. We will also examine a number of contemporary problems and explore their histories and backgrounds. Guest lecturers will present case studies in their own fields of study or professions. The course will not attempt to present a comprehensive survey of moral and political philosophy. Rather, we seek to excite your interest and enthusiasm for taking on big questions and give you some tools for thinking about them. Our hope is that you will continue to explore these and other questions throughout your years at the university.", "outcome": "By the end of the semester, students will have learned:\u00a0\u00a01. to recognise and analyse a range of key dilemmas they may need to face in their personal and professional lives, as well as in their lives as citizens and leaders in the community;\u00a02. to recognize the complexity of some dilemmas and to acquire some possible ways of thinking about them and of resolving them according to their own values;\u00a03. to understand the range of possible responses to some dilemmas and to learn to discuss the questions involved with reason and respect for the different views of others;\u00a04. to recognize the need for information to contextualize the dilemmas and certain reliable sources where the information may be found;\u00a05. to recognize that current dilemmas have histories, often in the remote past;\u00a06. to understand some of the complexities involved in some key current political dilemmas faced by leaders in Hong Kong, China and the wider world;\u00a07. some of the reasons why responsible people, citizens, and leaders everywhere, need to be well informed about current affairs;\u00a08. some of the personal benefits of taking an interest in current affairs, especially outside Hong Kong and China, by reading, watching, and listening to responsible sources of news.", "syllabus": "1.
