Such evolution is partially attributable to the emergence of corporate governance after a series of corporate scandals. A robust corporate governance regime within an organisation assists how the organisation operates and how business and strategic objectives can be attained. To achieve such, management needs to properly identify and manage a number of risks which may adversely affect the organisation\u2019s success. This is the reason why risk management forms a cornerstone for corporate governance. The next question will be how risk management strategies can be executed. This then brings the significance of internal control activities to light. There is therefore an inter-locking relationship between corporate governance, risk management and internal control activities. This course attempts to investigate these three areas and highlight how internal auditing can bring values to an organisation in the abovementioned aspects. \r\u00a0 \u00a0The course is divided into three main blocks: (i) corporate and board governance under the requirements of the Hong Kong Listing Rules (and relevant overseas requirements); (ii) risk identification, assessment and management techniques from the perspective of internal auditors; and (iii) compliance risk management with a discussion of various current business issues such as forensic investigations, anti-bribery programmes and anti-money laundering techniques.\r\u00a0\u00a0The objectives of the course are to:\r\u00a0(1) allow students to appreciate the relationships among corporate governance, risk management and internal controls;\u00a0(2) equip students with an understanding of the role of internal auditor in each of the above aspects and how an internal auditor can assist top management in achieving an organisation\u2019s strategic goals;\u00a0(3) strengthen students\u2019 awareness of the significance of risk management and internal controls in various important areas of operations;\u00a0(4) introduce concepts of various contemporary compliance and auditing-related issues; and\r\u00a0(5) strengthen students\u2019 communication and interpersonal skills.", "required_readings": "There is no single textbook covering all the materials for the course.
