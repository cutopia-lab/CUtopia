Mechanisms of signal transduction in cell proliferation and programmed cell death. As the final capstone module of this course, the significance of cell biology in understanding and improving human health and disease will be discussed. Clinical researchers may be invited to share their innovative research design and findings and to inspire our students about the importance of basic discoveries in applied studies.Topics 1-8 introduce students our current understanding about the structures, functions and mechanisms of a number of components in a eukaryotic cell and illustrate how these components interact, leading to cell proliferation and programmed cell death. The final capstone topic \u201cClinical Application of Cell Biology\u201d inspires the students about how they can apply what they have learned in the previous topics, seemingly fundamental and discrete, in an integrative manner for understanding and improving human health and diseases. This capstone topic will also stimulate the students to think out of the box and realize the significance of basic research in applied studies.Senior Student Mentorship Programme (SSMP) is implemented in this course so that the hundreds of students will be assigned into groups, mentoring by some selected senior students, who have taken this course before with good academic results. Besides sharing their learning experiences and answering their mentees\u2019 questions about cell biology, these senior students, who are mostly engaging in experimental projects in their capstone courses, can also inspire their mentees about the innovation and design of their scientific studies.

Behavioural ecology examines how behaviour contributes to survival and reproduction. The relationship between behaviour, ecology and evolution is emphasized. Population ecology concerns how populations grow and how they are limited by food, competition and predation. The community ecology component will focus on factors that determine the structure and function of biological communities, including nutrient cycles and biogeochemistry.

Case studies on the use of molecular data in the study of evolutionary processes, biogeography and the history of life (including human evolution) will be included. This course is specially designed for advanced level of undergraduates, not only because of the course content, but it requires the students to think and integrate knowledge learnt from different courses in biology, molecular biology, cell biology, biotechnology, genetics, ecology, etc. In addition, a problem will be initiated by students and to be solved via searching for knowledge and information from diverse channels not only limited to scientific journal articles. Furthermore, a voluntary/optional field trip is organized for the students to define the problem of their own interests.

We will focus on how global warming, and associated changes such as altered rainfall, sea level rise, and ocean acidification, have changed the biological communities of the Earth\u2019s various ecosystems, from forests to coral reefs. The impact at biological levels from molecules to cells, organisms, populations, and communities will be explored. Models for projecting future changes in Earth systems, biological communities and ecosystem services under climate change will be introduced. While the major focus is on climate change, other aspects of global environmental change, such as habitat deterioration, will also be considered. Students are required to present case studies of global change biology based on latest research findings.\r", "outcome": "Knowledge\r\u00a0\u2022 An understanding of fundamental topics in global change biology, including: the Earth system; changes in the physiology of organisms under altered environmental conditions; community and ecosystem responses; the human aspect; multiple stressors\r\u00a0\u2022 A recognition of the links between impacts on different levels of biological organization; from molecules to cells, organisms, populations, and communities\r\u00a0\u00a0Skill\r\u00a0\u2022 Development of generic skills necessary in Life Science fields including the ability to research a topic independently, find and synthesize information from literature, ask critical questions\r\u00a0\u2022 An introduction to approaches used to project future climates and organism/ecosystem responses\r\u00a0\u00a0Value\r\u00a0\u2022 An appreciation of current environmental changes that are unique relative to other periods in Earth history, and how these changes may impact ecosystem services that humans rely upon\r\u00a0\u2022 Recognition that local human actions may mitigate largely-unmanageable effects of global change\r\u00a0\u00a0\u77e5\u8b58\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 \u5c0d\u5168\u7403\u8b8a\u5316\u751f\u7269\u5b78\u6709\u57fa\u790e\u7684\u8a8d\u77e5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u5730\u7403\u7cfb\u7d71\u3001\u74b0\u5883\u689d\u4ef6\u6539\u8b8a\u5e36\u4f86\u7684\u751f\u7269\u751f\u7406\u6a5f\u80fd\u8b8a\u5316\u3001\u7fa4\u843d\u8207\u751f\u614b\u7cfb\u7d71\u5c0d\u74b0\u5883\u8b8a\u5316\u7684\u97ff\u61c9\u3001\u5168\u7403\u8b8a\u5316\u5c0d\u4eba\u985e\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u548c\u591a\u91cd\u61c9\u6fc0\u6e90\u3002\u00a0\u2022 \u7406\u89e3\u5168\u7403\u8b8a\u5316\u5c0d\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u7269\u6c34\u5e73\uff1a\u5206\u5b50\u3001\u7d30\u80de\u3001\u500b\u9ad4\u3001\u7a2e\u7fa4\u3001\u7fa4\u843d\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u5c64\u9762\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u806f\u7cfb\u3002\u00a0\u00a0\u6280\u80fd\u00a0\u2022 \u57f9\u990a\u751f\u547d\u79d1\u5b78\u9818\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u7368\u7acb\u5f9e\u4e8b\u79d1\u7814\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u95b1\u8b80\u6587\u737b\u4e26\u7e3d\u7d50\u904b\u7528\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u8003\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u00a0\u2022 \u4e86\u89e3\u751f\u547d\u79d1\u5b78\u6280\u8853\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u9810\u6e2c\u672a\u4f86\u6c23\u5019\u8b8a\u5316\u53ca\u751f\u7269\u9ad4\u6216\u751f\u614b\u7cfb\u7d71\u5c0d\u5176\u7684\u97ff\u61c9\u3002\u00a0\u00a0\u50f9\u503c\u00a0\u2022 \u8a8d\u77e5\u76ee\u524d\u5730\u7403\u53f2\u4e0a\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u74b0\u5883\u8b8a\u5316\u53ca\u5176\u5c0d\u4eba\u985e\u6240\u4f9d\u9644\u7684\u751f\u614b\u7cfb\u7d71\u9020\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u00a0\u2022 \u9818\u6703\u5230\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5c40\u90e8\u5730\u5340\u7684\u4eba\u985e\u5728\u884c\u70ba\u4e0a\u505a\u51fa\u6539\u8b8a\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7de9\u89e3\u68d8\u624b\u7684\u5168\u7403\u8b8a\u5316\u3002\u00a0\u00a0\u77e5\u8bc6\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 \u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u53d8\u5316\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u5730\u7403\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u6539\u53d8\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u751f\u7269\u751f\u7406\u673a\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u7fa4\u843d\u4e0e\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3001\u5168\u7403\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u591a\u91cd\u5e94\u6fc0\u6e90\u3002\u00a0\u2022 \u7406\u89e3\u5168\u7403\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u7269\u6c34\u5e73\uff1a\u5206\u5b50\u3001\u7ec6\u80de\u3001\u4e2a\u4f53\u3001\u79cd\u7fa4\u3001\u7fa4\u843d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u9762\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u00a0\u00a0\u6280\u80fd\u00a0\u2022 \u57f9\u517b\u751f\u547d\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u72ec\u7acb\u4ece\u4e8b\u79d1\u7814\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u9605\u8bfb\u6587\u732e\u5e76\u603b\u7ed3\u8fd0\u7528\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u8003\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u00a0\u2022 \u4e86\u89e3\u751f\u547d\u79d1\u5b66\u6280\u672f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u751f\u7269\u4f53\u6216\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u5176\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u00a0\u00a0\u4ef7\u503c\u00a0\u2022 \u8ba4\u77e5\u76ee\u524d\u5730\u7403\u53f2\u4e0a\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u6240\u4f9d\u9644\u7684\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u9020\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u00a0\u2022 \u9886\u4f1a\u5230\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5c40\u90e8\u5730\u533a\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u505a\u51fa\u6539\u53d8\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7f13\u89e3\u68d8\u624b\u7684\u5168\u7403\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "syllabus": "I.

In the management aspects, students will know the assessment method for deciding the endangered status of a species and thus formulate the proper conservation plan for a species. Students will know the principles of conservation practices in situ and ex situ for terrestrial and aquatic organisms and habitats.
