Introduction\u00a0This session gives an introduction to the development of the idea of \u2018art\u2019, and the mediation mechanism developed throughout history, and looks into the personal, institutional, social and cultural mode of looking at art.\u00a0\u00a02. Looking at art: what art and whose art?\u00a0The session discuss the creation of the concept of \u2018art\u2019 and its changing meaning art, as well as the political, economic and ideological context from which these concepts evolve, and how these concepts continue affect our ways of looking.\u00a0\u00a03. Ways of Seeing\u00a0The session focuses on John Berger\u2019s influential book \u2018Ways of Seeing\u2019 to introduce looking at art from a critical, ideological perspective. \u00a0\u00a04. Subject matters and its hierarchy\u00a0This session studies subject matters and the genres in art, and how the categorization of art reflects the infrastructure of power. Using mainly the hierarchy built by the 19th Century French Academy as study target, it studies the social and political values behind the choices of subject matters in art making. \u00a0\u00a05. Approaches and methodologies\u00a0This session studies the two fundamental ways of viewing art: formalism and historical studies. Some of the formal elements in art and the various approaches in art history analysis will be introduced.\u00a0\u00a06. Approaches and methodologies\u00a0This session focuses on iconographic and psychological approaches in art viewing, with studies ranging from religious painting to contemporary icons creation, as well as studying the impacts of the development of psychology in the ways of looking at art.\u00a0\u00a07. Approaches and methodologies\u00a0This session studies the contextual meaning of art, and how ideologies affect the viewing, interpretation and understanding of art, with a focus on the Marxist approach.\u00a0\u00a08. Approaches and methodologies\u00a0This session studies other approaches such as semiotic, feminist, structuarlist and post-structuralist, and other approaches.\u00a0\u00a09. Case study: Van Goth\u2019s Sunflower\u00a0This session studies only one painting, Van Gogh\u2019s \u2018Sunflower\u2019, and presents the many ways of looking at one painting as a summary of the studies of the different approaches in the last few classes.\u00a0\u00a010. Exercise: comparative studies\u00a0This session is mainly an exercise of looking, in which students are presented with images that come in pair and they have to identify the similarities and differences, and articulate the rationales and ideological implication behind them.\u00a0\u00a011. Looking at popular culture\u00a0The session applies the similar techniques learned for a critical viewing at popular culture in order to gain an understanding of the impacts of popular culture in the shaping our ways of looking.\u00a0\u00a012. Image marketing, consumerism and propaganda\u00a0This session continues the studies of popular culture, with a focus on visual images in public media as a form of propaganda for consumption and for political purposes. \u00a0\u00a013.

Culture and Ideology\u00a0Ideology is a key concept in cultural theory. This section explores the political role of culture in society and discusses the relationship between culture and ideology. It provides five definitions of ideology and shows the way in which ideology works. \u00a0\u00a03. Representation and Materialism \u00a0Much of cultural theoryis dedicated to explaining how meaning is produced symbolically in language. Two important concepts are relevant: representation explores the textual generation of meaning and the modes; materialism is concerned with why meanings are inscribed at the moment of production.

The \u2018Culture and Civilization\u2019 Tradition\u00a0Matthew Arnold inaugurates a tradition which places popular culture within the general field of culture, known as the \u2018culture and civilization\u2019 tradition. Carrying on this tradition, F.R. Leavis has shaped the understanding of mass civilization and minority culture. This section introduces the \u2018culture and civilization\u2019 tradition and its connection to popular art.\u00a0\u00a06. Culturalism I: Hoggart, Williams and Thompson\u00a0Culturalism has been the most vigorous, indigenous strand within cultural studies in Britain. Hoggart, Williams and Hall exemplify the critical moments of the evolution of cultural theory. This section will introduce their works and discuss the influence of their thoughts in shaping later theories. \u00a0\u00a07. Culturalism II: Hall and Whanneland the Popular Arts\u00a0Hoggart, Williams and Thompson have a major influence on the understanding of the popular arts. Stuart Hall and Paddy Whannel\u2019s thesis, The Popular Arts, will be discussed.

The ideas and works of Jacques Derrida and Jacques Lacan will be introduced. This section will also discuss the works by Michel Foucault and Edward Said regarding discourse and power. \u00a0\u00a010. Marxism I: Classical Marxism and Neo-Gramscian Studies \u00a0This section will begin with the introduction of a classical Marxist approach to culture, such as its famous \u2018base/superstructure\u2019 account of social and historical development, the determinations that influence the production and consumption of popular culture, and the mode of production. Itwill then proceed to discuss Antonio Gramsci and the core concept of hegemony.\u00a0\u00a011. Marxism II: The Frankfurt School and Cultural Industry\u00a0The Frankfurt School has been famous for its critical theory that mixes Marxism and psychoanalysis,as well as the term of \u2018cultural industry\u2019 that it coined. This section will introduce the basic concepts of the Frankfurt School, the major representative figures and their critique of cultural industry. \u00a0\u00a012. Feminism and Gender\u00a0Gender has been an important subject of study since the 1980s. Several issues will be discussed in this section, such as cultural politics and feminist psychoanalysis.

Food has always been an essential category in human culture. The amount of food surplus determines the strength and social bonding of a society; and rituals are usually revolved around food preparation, presentation, and distribution. In China, a large number of archaeological sites contained remains of food, and occasionally drink. This course picks the representative sites to illustrate what food meant to a society that can be summarized in categories listed below: 1. Consumption of staple food: rice and noodles; 2. Perception of tastes: sweetness and bitterness; 3. Cooking methods: steaming and roasting; 4. Exotic food: what had been imported to China and when? 5. Drinks: tea and wine; 6. Rituals that involved food. This course is suitable for students who have interests in Archaeology but may not have prior knowledge about it. It aims to prepare them for exploring the past of China in the future, either in form of class teaching or self-learning, or both. The course gets students to apply the designs and innovations of ancient China in regards to food and the practice of cooking, dining and rituals to the present.\r", "outcome": "Upon completion of the course, students would be able to: \r\u00a01) Identify key recent archaeological discoveries of China;\u00a02) Analyze the functions and meanings of archaeological finds in particular contexts; \u00a03) Acquire research techniques in reading primary data; and \r\u00a04) Think critically about archaeological presentations, such as museum exhibitions, and relevant cultural events", "syllabus": "Part I: Discoveries of food and drinks\r\u00a0\u00a01.

Rice and Hemudu Culture (5500\u20143300 BC)\r\u00a0Carbonated rice husk was found in a number of early and mid-Neolithic sites in China. All evidence points to the origins in the mid and lower Yangtze River valley. This lecture uses Hemudu site as an example.

Noodles and the site of Lajia of Qijia Culture (c.2500\u2014c.2000 BC)\r\u00a0Lajia of Qinghai province is the Chinese version of Pompeii. It was a small town destroyed and covered by dust right after an earthquake. There preserved a bow of unfinished noodles made of millet (\u5c0f\u7c73) and husk millet (\u9ecd\u7c73). The noodles still carried a tinge of the original yellowish colour. This lecture begins with the finds at Lajia and refers to many other archaeological evidence of noodles consumption found in later periods. \r\u00a0Reading:\r\u00a0a. \u738b\u660e\u8f1d\uff0c\u300a\u9752\u6d77\u6c11\u548c\u5587\u5bb6\u907a\u5740\u767c\u6398\u5831\u544a\u300b,\u300a\u8003\u53e4\u300b2000.12, \u7b2c12\u201428\u9875\u3002\r\u00a0b. \u8449\u8302\u6797\uff0c\u300a\u5587\u5bb6\u907a\u5740\u8207\u98f2\u98df\u6587\u660e\u300b\uff0c\u300a\u4e2d\u570b\u98f2\u98df\u6587\u5316\u300b2008\uff0c4(2)\uff0c45\u201476\u3002\r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04. Jiaozi (Dumplings) and the State of Xue (?\u2014327 BC)\r\u00a0Jiaozi takes in different forms in Chinese cuisine. The earliest evidence came from a site in the State of Xue of the Warring States period (c.476\u2014221 BC).

Meat and wine and the Xianyang Airport site\r\u00a0In 2009, a bowl of meat soup was found in Xi\u2019an. Domesticated pigs, sheep and ox were found in as early as late Neolithic. Boiling was the primary method of cooking. In Xi\u2019an this tomb of the Han dynasty revealed the soup serving, as well as bottle of wine.

Fieldtrip: Sauces and Seasoning\r\u00a0Sauces are not commonly found at archaeological sites. Because Hong Kong has a number of locally produced sauce workshops, a fieldtrip to one of them is enriching. The arrangement has to be made in due course. Otherwise, the fieldtrip may be a visit to a relevant museum exhibition in Hong Kong or Shenzhen.\r\u00a0\u00a07. Snacks and the early Han-dynasty tombs of Mawangdui, Hunan province\r\u00a0When food surplus is sufficient, snacks are desired.

Tofu and the Han-dynasty Tomb at Mixian Dahuting, Henan province \r\u00a0Tofu was not preserved in any archaeological site. But the process of making tofu was recorded. At Mixian, the relief paintings found in the tomb illustrate the tofu-making processes in detail, along with other cooking and food preparing pictures. It remains a mystery as to why the people of the Han preserved such scenes in burials.

Bread and the Western Xia Hoard of Inner Mongolia \r\u00a0Bread or bun did not survive well in most archaeological sites. But a hoard of Western Xia in Inner Mongolia revealed several well-preserved pieces. The Inner Asian forms of these finds related them to the Silk Road. In fact, a number of dried food examples came from that part of the world, because the dry weather favoured preservation. \r\u00a0Reading:\r\u00a0a. \u4f0a\u514b\u662d\u76df\u6587\u7269\u5de5\u4f5c\u7ad9\uff0c\u300a\u51c6\u683c\u723e\u65d7\u767c\u73fe\u897f\u590f\u7a96\u85cf\u300b\uff0c\u300a\u6587\u7269\u300b1987.8\u3002\r\u00a0b. \u738b\u4ec1\u6e58\uff0c\u300a\u8003\u53e4\u8cb4\u5dde\u300b\uff0c\u96fb\u8996\u5ee3\u64ad\u8cc7\u6e90\u3002\r\u00a0\u00a010.

Exotic food \r\u00a0Chili, spices, potatoes, and a number of essential ingredients in Chinese cuisines came from abroad at different times. How did they manage to enter an established food culture? \r\u00a0\u00a012. Guest lecture \r\u00a0In China, food is a topic inevitably related to health, festivals and rituals. It will be exciting to include a lecture to be given by a specialist in Religious Studies, Chinese Medicine, or Maritime Trade, who has research interests in food. The lecture provides another dimension of looking at Chinese food.\r\u00a0\u00a013. Food and rituals \r\u00a0In conclusion, food is indispensable in social lives and rituals. In the examples discussed, food was always found in tombs, closely associated with the desires of nourishment, social engagement, and even hierarchy.

The downfall of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republican China transformed the social and institutional organisation of the production, distribution, and consumption of art as well as the traditional patronage system in modern China. The structural changes conditioned the emergence of formal and informal art institutions that facilitated yet constrained artistic practices, laying the foundation for the development of a modern art world in China. The course looks at the history of modern Chinese art and the formation of different art institutions in the sociocultural and economic context of modern China. Weekly topics are structured chronologically and thematically, which cover a wide range of themes, including art schools, art societies, museums, exhibitions, and art market. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, the course offers students multi-perspectives to understand the transformation of modern Chinese art and the interactions between artistic practices and society in modern China.", "outcome": "\u2022 Explain the theory of the artworld and history of art institutions in modern China.\r\u00a0\u2022 Identify and describe the historical background, aesthetics, and social factors reflected in specific artworks.\r\u00a0\u2022 Identify and interpret the correlation between artistic styles and the institutional organisation.\r\u00a0\u2022 Reflect upon the roles of art institutions in the process of art creation, production, distribution and consumption. \r\u00a0\u2022 Select research materials and develop original research topics on modern Chinese art.", "syllabus": "1.

The course will begin from the basic by introducing the mainstream material productions from ancient to modern China: jades, antique bronzes, lacquer, ceramics, architecture, silk, as well as grave goods. The discussions instruct students to appreciate these essential elements of Chinese culture from the perspectives of their physical qualities, craftsmanship, and historical values. They are also to encourage students to think about the roles of material objects in shaping cultural, ethnic, and even national identities.", "outcome": "Upon completion of the course, students would be able to identify the material and artistic features of some mainstream Chinese artifacts; develop interests in Chinese culture from the perspective of objects; identify key historical sites and remains of pre-modern China; develop acute senses for appreciating traditions and values; develop interests in culture and history; analyze the sources of Chinese heritage and traditions; think critically about historical and other relevant cultural presentations; and get prepared for further trainings in the disciplines of art history, archaeology, anthropology and history.", "syllabus": "1. Introduction: What is the present view about Chinese material culture? \u00a0Present-day China received huge inheritance from the many groups of people and cultural traditions that existed in antiquity. This session introduce a range of material culture that makes up the broad family of Chinese culture. The most important types include jades, antique bronzes, lacquer, ceramics, and architecture. The definitions given here hope to broaden the scope and include the less-discussed categories of clothing and costumes, sculpture, and grave goods. This overview leads students to consider the many sources of traditional values now embodied in the material culture that we now describe as \u2018Chinese\u2019.\u00a0\u00a02. Jades\u00a0In China, jades have always been understood to have spiritual power and artistic values. What is the scientific definition of jades? How did Confucius and his contemporaries define the roles of jades? How did their teachings shape the understanding of jades in Chinese society? And what are the present views about jades? This session will respond to this question by giving a review of jade history, usage and craftsmanship.\u00a0\u00a03. Antique bronzes\u00a0Among the many treasures inherited from the past, bronzes are core collections that they are always found as representatives of ancient China in modern museums both in China and overseas. This session will describe different categories of bronzes and the motifs found on them in relation to their dates. It will also introduce the imperial collections found in the Kaogu tu, and later on in Xiqing gujian; and explain the values and significance of bronze collections in modern museums. \u00a0\u00a04. Lacquer\u00a0Lacquer is a unique production of ancient China. This session introduces the complicated steps involved in its production, and reviews lacquer-using history in China and in other parts of Asia. The discussion leads student to become aware of the broad transmission of the lacquer-using traditions in Asia that shaped a central role for China in antiquity.\u00a0\u00a05. Sculpture\u00a0In China, sculptural representation is closely tied with religious practices. This session will introduce the Buddhist sites in Henan and Sichuan, as well as the pictorial representations found in the Daoist temples in Hebei. The session will describe the renewed definition of sculpture in the modern times when the Western artistic values were received.\u00a0\u00a06. Architecture\u00a0Architecture forms an essential part of material culture. In China, however, the studies of historical architecture began rather late. This session introduces the classic writings by Liang Sicheng, as well as the renowned Yingcao fasi, the Building Manual composed in the Song period, which founded the standardized Chinese construction works. \u00a0\u00a07. Silk\u00a0Silk production began in the late Neolithic period. This session introduces the traditional steps in silk-making and weaving as found in craftsman handbooks published in the Ming period; and discusses how silk as commodity embodies the rich history of cultural exchange between China and the West through trade.\u00a0\u00a08. Ceramics\u00a0Ceramics are representative productions of south China. This session introduces the production of the classic kilns of Ge, Yu, Ding, Longquan, and Jingdezhen. This session instructs students to identify the colour, texture, decoration, as well as motifs found on the ceramics produced in different areas. They embody rich aesthetic values deemed appropriate in Confucian classics.\u00a0\u00a09. Ornaments\u00a0Chinese ornaments comprise an extended family of motifs that include flowers, birds, figures, beasts, characters, as well as scenes. This session discuss two key groups: plants and dragons. The former was adopted from both nature and religious practices; whereas the latter was acquired through cultural construction over time. This session discusses how the two genres merged along difference courses into what we understand as being Chinese today. \u00a0\u00a010. Chinese calligraphy and paintings\u00a0Chinese calligraphy and paintings represent a major aesthetic system that includes the use of ink and brush, writing, as well as imagination particularly defined in Daoist writings. This session introduces the basic concepts of calligraphy and the features found in the classic paintings from the Song to the Qing periods. \u00a0\u00a011. Grave goods: objects for the deceased \u00a0Mingqi is a unique category of items produced in China. It is a group of goods created especially for the burial with the deceased that they are closely connected with the Chinese ideas about ghosts, spirits, and afterlife. This session will review the history of mingqi from as early as the Bronze Age, and look into how this understanding is translated in modern practice.\u00a0\u00a012. Antique collection and modern consumerism\u00a0The antiquities of China provide a resourceful base for modern designers and cultural industries. In light of modern consuming practices, Chinese designers, architects, museum workers, historians, and other culture-related professionals fall back on inheritance to seek for ideas to create something new and unique for the country. This session reviews the concerns of relevant practitioners. \u00a0\u00a013. Conclusion \u00a0The concluding session outline the present ideas about material culture and its role in modern society, which is a topic that has become increasingly important in the spheres of anthropology and sociology. This session will combine the discussions on Chinese material culture and the discourse of object studies. This will give students ideas to develop interests in the study of China; and enable them to engage the past with the present.", "required_readings": "Primary textbooks\u00a0i. Dant, Tim.

The popularity of the word reflects the growing importance of assembling, managing and presenting data and collection, a process of gathering information that brings maximum value relevant to different audiences.In this context, this course is designed to provide students with an opportunity to learn about both historical and contemporary examples of how culture is understood through exhibition design and curating. By covering various forms of curatorial traditions, disruptive ideas, and emergent digital practices in the ever-expanding field of curation, this course equips students with the ability to question what they take for granted and reflect on existing issues conducive to different cultures, values and beliefs. By the end of the course, students will be able to critically examine how knowledge is created inside and outside of art institutions and how curation could potentially become public knowledge.", "outcome": "Upon completing this course, students will be able to:\r\u00a0\u2022 Explain key historical and contemporary examples of exhibition design and curating, relating to a wider local and global context\r\u00a0\u2022 Examine critical issues concerning ways that different cultures, values and beliefs are represented through curation\r\u00a0\u2022 Develop skills to critically analyze how knowledge is created inside and outside art institutions\r\u00a0\u2022 Acquire personal and social competencies to transfer curating into knowledge sharing and act as an active agent in facilitating knowledge engagement \r\u00a0\u2022 Develop an attitude of innovation and creativity by challenging assumptions in the ever-expanding field of curation", "syllabus": "Major concept/topics\r\u00a01) A brief history of curating and exhibition making\r\u00a0\u2022 Graham, B.

Aesthetics and art criticisms are critical in directing art interpretation and presentation. Contemporary management of visual arts responds predominantly to the worldwide discussions on modernism as well as various post-modernist writings. In addition, it has to operate in accordance with the prescribed state policy. For this bilateral concern of art management, the course comprises two sections. The first section leads students to study the writings on aesthetics by critics from Plato to Foucault, whose arguments are still valid in inspiring many art exhibitions. The second section discusses the practical concerns and techniques in maximizing the social and economic impacts of art exhibitions and relevant events. Both sections discuss case studies taken from different parts of the world.", "outcome": "Upon completion of the course, students will be able to describe different categories of visual arts in professional language; to define and explain the key terms in visual art literature; to appreciate and analyze art exhibitions with reference to intellectual debates on aesthetics; to describe and explain the art policies implemented in East Asia and the West; and to develop independent thinking on the operation and promotion of art organizations.", "syllabus": "Section I: Aesthetics and art criticisms \r\u00a0\u00a01. Introduction: Shifting perspectives on visual art management in the 20th century \r\u00a0Visual art management was a new discipline born in late 19th century when museums appeared in Europe. This session reviews the early practices in museum curatorship and its transformations under the impact of modernism. It explains how the focus in managing visual art shifted from scholarly field to public arena in the 21st century. \r\u00a0\u00a02. \u2018Is it good art?\u2019: From Plato, Hume to Danto on aesthetics \r\u00a0\u2018What is beauty?\u2019 has been the most discussed topic in Western art history since the times of Plato. This session discusses the canonical writings by Plato and his followers and critics during the times of Renaissance. The discussion links to their contributions to the post-modern theories that still weigh importantly today. \r\u00a0\u00a03. Visuality and Perception\r\u00a0The intention of artists and the perception of arts of the beholders are core issues in Western aesthetics. This section discusses the most well-read writings by Ernest Gombrich and John Berger, who respond to the question as to whether arts comprise social values. \r\u00a0\u00a04. \u2018Does Fine Arts still stand today?\u2019: From fine arts to commercial arts \r\u00a0Visual arts comprise a wide range of categories today that include both traditional oil paintings and sculpture, as well as contemporary art forms that includes installation, and industrial designs. This section discusses the shifting definitions of arts and the incorporation of commercial arts in exhibitions. \r\u00a0\u00a05. Cross-cultural aesthetics \r\u00a0Are Western art theories applicable to the Asian contexts? Correlation exists between civilization and visual culture. This session discusses the Chinese visual art system and explains its difference from that in the West. \r\u00a0\u00a0Section II: Concerns and Practices \r\u00a0\u00a06. Writing and arts \r\u00a0This lecture analyzes different texts about visual arts taken from museum exhibition catalogues, auction house catalogues, newspaper reviews, as well as commercial gallery publications. This leads students to reflect on the different presentations of arts for education and commercial purposes. \r\u00a0\u00a07. Arts and state \r\u00a0This lectures discusses the various policies implemented in the US, UK, and China that enables or hinders the developments of art organizations and individual artists. \r\u00a0\u00a08. Business and Arts \r\u00a0Artists and art organizations s management relies heavily on the patronage of business firm. This session discuss the mutual relationship between arts and business, as well as their shifting roles in recent decades. \r\u00a0\u00a09. Audience and arts \r\u00a0This lecture extends the discussion of the last, and focuses on the concerns and strategies of art and cultural promoters in non-profit, educational sectors. This introduces the issue of branding implemented in many world renowned institutes and evaluates their success. \r\u00a0\u00a010. Managers and arts \r\u00a0This lecture discusses human resources management in the art industry. Examples of excellent directorship taken from the UK and US will be studied to shed light on the significance of professional leadership in the discipline. \r\u00a0\u00a011. The Biennial fever \r\u00a0Bienne is world recognized art event to showcase and acknowledge the achievements of young artists. This lecture discusses the organization and social impacts of the bienne festivals held in Europe and Asia. \r\u00a0\u00a012.

It looks at how the artists found interests in the new devices and how they employed so in expressing thoughts and feelings during the so-called Dadaist and Pop Movement. \r\u00a0\u00a03.Virtual Effects and Visual Culture\r\u00a0New technologies gave visual culture a new life in the 20th century that opened up many different opportunities of making interaction through the use of prints, drawings, photographs, and videos. This lecture discusses the concepts of simulation and immersion in visual arts. It also introduces the concept of virtual reality, which has been widely applied in both two and three-dimensional work. \r\u00a0\u00a04.Films and Animations \r\u00a0This lecture continues the last one in discussing the idea of realism and representation in media production. This one focuses on the images reproduced in films and video games. It discusses the theories employed in photography and filming with digital devices that lead students to think how the new technologies alter the traditional views about representation. \r\u00a0\u00a05.Economy and the Web Media \r\u00a0The New Media is often regarded as being reasonably economical in operation, compared with other traditional means of presentation. This lecture discusses the economic aspects of using different web engines and forums, as well as the commercial limits in employing those devices. \r\u00a0\u00a06. Wikis and Web 2.0 \r\u00a0Web 2.0 is a concept introduced at the beginning of this century to describe the combination of software (HTML), hardware, and Internet in forming a major sector of social interaction. The Wikipedia introduced in 2004 gave every user a new participant identity in the virtual world. This lecture discusses how the boom of Internet information alter social practices and ideas. \r\u00a0\u00a07.Games, Animation And the Cyber-world\r\u00a0In countries, such as Japan and Korea, games and animation form a major sector in the creative industries.

Community art serves as a tool for community development, based on the understanding that expression, mastery and communication through the arts powerfully encode cultural values, thus bringing deeper meanings of experience, participation and involvement, sense of belonging to the general public and the community. This course aims to advance students\u2019 understanding of public and community arts by embedding them in the theoretical discussions and critiques of cities and public spaces and practical experiences. It also imparts the knowledge and skills about managing public arts and actualizing community art programs, and discusses the way to support their development responding to the needs.", "outcome": "In terms of knowledge acquisition, students are expected to understand how public and community arts emerged in the context of urban regeneration and community activist movements. Students are encouraged to critically analyze the meanings and social values of public art spaces. In terms of managerial concepts and skills, students will learn how public and community arts are supported by government policies, material resources, infrastructure and training. Students are expected to understand public art commission and reception, to master basic principles of utilizing public art as an urban design strategy, and to apply varying approaches to facilitating community art development, for example, advancing community art education, utilizing the cultural planning approach to assess community based cultural resources and the place-event approach to creating a sense of community attachment.", "syllabus": "Part I. Understanding Public and Community Art\u00a01. General Introduction\u00a0This section begins with displaying a range of public and community art cases and presents an introduction to the course. Three issues are covered in this introductory lecture. First, this section provides the conceptual discussions of public space, public art, and their art forms to enable students to understand what public art space and public art is. Second, this section explores the role of artists in public art space and community development. Third, a historical picture of public art is unfolded, which traces its origin, displays its developing process, and takes a glimpse into its enshrined social values. \u00a0\u00a02. Understanding Public Art Spaces \u00a0How should we understand public art spaces and the public nature of public art? This section embeds these issues into the understanding of a city; it then conveys the ideas that public spaces are socially produced and that city forms are imbued with ideologies. Public art stems from an urban setting and then grows through the urban regeneration movement, which comprises several issues, such as urban image, urban form and urban planning as well as their connections with public art space as a form of representational space. Furthermore, this section explores the public nature of public art by examining the process, by which artists derive value from individual creativity in the studios and immense it into the public space. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss the alternative history of public art (Lacy, 1995, 25\u201328).\u00a0\u00a03. Public Art: The Monument\u00a0The monument is an important theoretical perspective to conceptualize public art. This section explains what a \u201cmonument\u201d is and investigates its role\u2014whether statue, memorial, or public statue\u2014in upholding a value-laden system of Western society. Issues under examination range from the connection between monument and national identity, the power and representation of public arts, the transformative understanding of public art as a monument, and the contradictions of public art. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss the public nature of public art.\u00a0\u00a04. Critical Issues of Public Art Spaces\u00a0Who comprise the \u201caudience\u201d of public arts? What does \u201cintention\u201d mean and what is the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of public art? This section further discusses the theories on critical issues related to public art. This section begins with the discussions of the relevant terms and proceeds to various critical thoughts that challenge the value of public art and question its public nature. Students are expected to be able to analyze public art spaces and public art critically.\u00a0Tutorial: Develop critical thinking about public art spaces and public art.\u00a0\u00a05. Public Arts and Community Cultural Development: Theoretical Underpinnings of Community Art\u00a0This section provides a synopsis of the histories and theoretical issues of community art. The origin of community art is traced to the discourse of William Morris\u2019s call for social reintegration of artists and a revival of art in the 19th century. Theoretical issues include the \u201cpopular front\u201d and class consciousness, civil rights and identity politics, as well as cultural democracy and exchange. In addition, this section discusses the definitions of community, the role of community art, and the core purposes of community development. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss the question, \u201cWhat makes art valuable?\u201d \u00a0\u00a0Part II. Public Art Management \u00a06. Commission and Reception of Public Art\u00a0Based on the public nature of art, this section analyzes the process of art making, which comprises the elements of audience, context, and meaning. The process includes the following: acquiring cultural approval, arriving in public sites and places, providing visiting experiences with the audience, and generating meanings. Cases of Seattle and New York are used for this study. With regard to art reception, it analyzes the issues of taste, the education of the audience, as well as the relationship of art to society and popular visual culture. In addition, this section also distinguishes performance culture from monumental public art.\u00a0Tutorial: Distinguish public art from community art.\u00a0\u00a07. Public Art and Urban Design\u00a0This section presents an urban design approach to commissioning and making public art. It outlines the principles for creating a city image, which consists of five elements, and discusses their connections to public art. Various forms of public art in association with the urban setting and the mechanism of public art utilization as an urban design strategy are also discussed. Students are guided toward understanding the role of public arts in urban design guidelines. Moreover, we also discussed a set of design principles on the relationship between public art and various urban forms and spatial components, aimed at integrating public art into the urban setting as context and reference is discussed.\u00a0Tutorial: Conduct design software training. \u00a0Assignment: Find a sample of public art (i.e., sculpture) using design principles to assess its location, site, and designs as well as to evaluate its strengths and weaknesses. Write a paper based on the research and use the design software to illustrate the arguments. \u00a0\u00a08. Government Policies for Public and Community Art Development\u00a0The relation between power and public and community art is a critical issue in public and community art management. This section discusses the governmental structure that funds and commissions public art, the infrastructure that underpins public art, and the governmental policies that support community art. The selection of commissions and projects is discussed, along with the process of seeking public and professional responses. International and the local Hong Kong contexts are examined to explore how government policies affect public and community art. In the local context, the role of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department in promoting public art in Hong Kong is adopted as a case study.\u00a0Tutorial: Conduct an in-class test. \u00a0\u00a09. Public Art in Metropolitan Cities\u00a0This section analyzes the role of public art in metropolitan cities, especially in the spheres of public transport, public open spaces, and public health system. A number of cases are presented, including forms of public art in the New York Subway system, London Underground and Mass Transit Railway, and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Hong Kong. The issue of commissioning public arts is revisited in the public art in metropolitan context. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss urban design and public art in Hong Kong.\u00a0\u00a0Part III. Community Art Management\u00a010. Developmental Needs of the Field\u00a0How can community art development be supported? What do communities need? This section specifies the scope of cultural policies and the policy climate that community artists and community cultural development require. Moreover, this section discusses the material support that community cultural organizations and artists need, including funding supports and internal infrastructure and exchange.\u00a0Tutorial: Discuss the cultural policies for public art in Hong Kong.\u00a0\u00a011. From Theory to Practice I: Process to Develop Community Arts\u00a0From theory to practice, this section offers students a general orientation, which serves as a road map to the community-based art process. Five conceptual territories to advance community-based art as well as requisite techniques to fulfill tasks are introduced in this section, which include the following: 1) contacting people in the community; 2) conducting research on the culture of the community and the people\u2019s perception of their community; 3) taking actions to make art projects; 4) gaining feedbacks from the community; and 5) incorporating these art forms into community art education programs to pass on skills and sustain the impact. The program also includes strategies for planning and organizing community outreach and engagement programs as well as ways to enhance public awareness.\u00a0Tutorial: Discuss the process of applying theories in the creation of community art in order to practice and initiate the group project with the community.\u00a0\u00a012. From Theory to Practice II: Key Issues in Community Art Development\u00a0Based on the holistic picture of the steps to develop community arts, this section focuses on certain key and challenging issues in the process, specifically those on research methods and art making. The section introduces qualitative and quantitative research methods for the project of community art development, and students are expected to learn how to identify survey areas, design survey questionnaires, run group discussions, and map cultural mind-sets and assets. Another key issue is how to make arts and work with artists. An artist will be invited to be the guest speaker to give the lesson.\u00a0Tutorial: Develop a group project with the community. \u00a0\u00a013. Review and discussions\u00a0Students will present their on-going group projects on community art development, and the professor then provides comments and feedbacks on their projects. Key points of this course will also be reviewed in this class.", "required_readings": "Goldbard, A., 2006, New Creative Community: The Art of Cultural Development, Oakland, CA: New Village Press. \u00a0Grogan, D., Mercer, C. and Engwicht, D., 1996, The Cultural Planning Handbook, St. Leonards, N.S.W.: Allen & Unwin,\u00a0Harris, S.

Curators produce knowledge, engage their audience, spark innovation, and constantly challenge the role of \u201ccurator\u201d beyond the confines of the status quo across varied institutional settings. This course aims to provide students with hands-on experience in exhibition curation and engages students in a broad spectrum of real-world experiences and professional networking opportunities, aiming to prepare students for future curatorial projects/jobs. It covers topics such as idea conceptualization, proposal writing, pitching, budgeting, contracting, publication, exhibition design, installation and exhibition maintenance. By co-curating an exhibition in a non-profit art space in Hong Kong, students will take part in the various stages of exhibition making.

The world of ancient China is a rich source of inspirations for museum work; tourism; films and documentary; literature; designs; and even commercial productions. Yet misinterpretations over Chinese history have led to problematic descriptions of heritage and archaeological sites. Indeed, there have not been many discussions of Chinese historical past independent of texts, and this course intends to fill up the lacuna. Taking ancient and medieval China as subjects, this course leads student to appreciate Chinese arts and archaeological finds from between the Neolithic and the 13th century. The course urges students to develop acute senses in reading and writing about heritage for contemporary needs.", "outcome": "Upon completion of the course, students would be able to identify key historical sites and remains of pre-modern China; analyze the roles and management of heritage or its relevant institutions; think critically about historical exhibitions and other cultural events; develop acute senses for appreciating traditions and values; develop interests in culture and history; and get prepared for career related to management of heritage and arts industries.", "syllabus": "1. Introduction: Why is material culture? What is heritage? \u00a0What is the difference between history and archaeology? Why should we pay attention to material objects? This session introduces the discipline of archaeology and describes its application in China. It defines what we speak of Chinese heritage from the perspective of material remains. \u00a0\u00a02. Neolithic China: The Rise of Numerous Jade-using Sources \u00a0As of 2014, more than 10 different Neolithic cultures have been identified in China. To what extent have we moved beyond the old understanding about Yangshao and Longshan cultures in central China? What do the new finds tell us about China during the Neolithic times (c.5000\u2014c.2000 BC). And how do they fit into the unified picture of what we call \u2018China\u2019 today. \u00a0\u00a03. The Shang period: the Dawn of Civilization \u00a0There are some textual descriptions about the Shang dynasty. But its archaeological boundaries are subject to debates. This session introduces the key Shang sites in Henan, as well as their contemporary sites found in Sichuan, Hunan, and other Chinese provinces. It leads student to pay attention to the interpretation presented in most Chinese museum\u2014all Bronze Age cultures were re-think the connections between the early Bronze Age and the present. \u00a0\u00a04. Western Zhou: The Early Development of Cultural Borrowings\u00a0Western Zhou is understood as one of the most esteemed periods in antiquity. This session looks into the archaeological finds from the 10th to 8th century BC and discusses what bronzes tell us about the several important political decisions the Zhou courts made to consolidate sovereignty. One key policy that the Zhou founders implemented was adaptation to various cultural streams collected from the preceding Shang and other neighbouring groups. This was an unknown yet profoundly important aspect of the Zhou that prepared it for taking the lead of what we today call \u2018Chinese\u2019 civilization. \u00a0\u00a05. Eastern Zhou: The Age of Conformity\u00a0The flourishing workshops of bronze-casting, lacquers, pottery, and textiles from the Eastern Zhou period provide a vast number of important archaeological finds. This session introduces some key sites, which include Sanmengxia and Leigudun. From them we will discuss the significance of material culture in forming shared heritage roots. \u00a0Reading: Sullivan 2008, chapter 1, pp. 45\u201463.\u00a0\u00a06. Han I: Burial Culture\u00a0The Han dynasty is a promising period with many textual records and archaeological finds. This first session looks into the Han tomb structure and burial goods, which present some interesting patterns in the religious ideas and practices of the period. \u00a0Reading: Sullivan 2008, chapter 1, pp. 65\u201497.\u00a0\u00a07. Han II: the Silk Road\u00a0Connections with the West were well-formed under the Han regime. This session looks at the finds from the Silk Road, which continued to be in use throughout the Han and its following centuries. This session reviews the finds from the Silk Road and discusses their significance for both the intellectual and public sphere in the present times. \u00a0Reading: Sullivan 2008, chapter 1, pp. 65\u201497.\u00a0\u00a08. Northern & Southern Dynasties: Buddhism in China\u00a0Buddhism began to appear in China from the Han times, and became vastly important throughout the divided Northern and Southern dynasties. This session introduces the key caves of Buddhist sculpture and discusses the impacts of Buddhist ideas on later Chinese material creations. In particular, Buddhism helped develop a range of ornamental features unprecedentedly formed in the context of China; yet those features have become central in the presentation of Chinese heritage today. \u00a0Reading: Sullivan 2008, chapter 1, pp. 99\u2014129\u00a0\u00a09. Tang Dynasty: The Cosmopolitan Cities \u00a0This session focuses on the settlement finds from the Tang period. Little is known about ancient Chinese cities or settlement sites, which were prone to destruction. This session leads students to reflect on the urban life in Metropolitan Tang, which was benefited from the access to various exotic goods acquired through the Silk Road. \u00a0Reading: Sullivan 2008, chapter 1, pp. 131\u2014161.\u00a0\u00a010. Song I: Antiquarianism and Imperial Collections of Arts\u00a0The Song dynasty was the age of the studies of antiquities. This lecture introduces the early catalogues of imperial collections that developed the sense of shared inheritance from the ninth century. \u00a0Reading: Sullivan 2008, chapter 1, pp. 163\u2014205.\u00a0\u00a011. Song II: Mural Paintings \u00a0Mural paintings are important finds from the tombs of the Song period. They usually represent the tomb owners in household quarters, engaged in various activities. More importantly, the neighbouring Qidan and Jin peoples also copied such tradition. This session leads student to discuss the importance in the exchange of burial practices and ideas. \u00a0Reading: Sullivan 2008, chapter 1, pp. 163\u2014205.\u00a0\u00a012. Guest lecture/field trip, venue to be decided. \u00a0This session will bring some fresh air to the classroom by taking students to look at modern presentation of Chinese material culture. The permanent gallery of the Hong Kong Art Museum will be a good choice. But it depends on the range of exhibitions available during the teaching period. If possible, a trip to visit the site in Guangzhou or Shenzhen will produce constructive impression about modern understanding of China past. \u00a0\u00a013. Conclusion and discussions of final papers. \u00a0This session summarizes the key issues collected from the above lectures. This is hoped to open up discussions for students to review the various sources of traditions that were gathered to form the core of Chinese civilization.", "required_readings": "1.

What are the essential elements of museum catalogues and cultural writing?3. How do museum workers balance both marketing and social needs?4.

Think critically about museum exhibitions and other cultural events.", "syllabus": "1 Introduction:What is a museum? \u00a0The introduction gives an overview of the museum structure and definition. This will introduce the various types of museums established around the world, defined according to the range of their collections. This will also compare the organization structure of a museum, in which the curatorial teams are working with a range of specialists relevant. \u00a0\u00a02 The history of museums \u00a0The \u2018history\u2019 of museum sounds alien to the context of museum studies. But museum workers are coming to beware that the museums are products of modernity that marked a distinctive times in which antiquities could be treated as shared, public properties. This lecture reviews the establishments of the Louvre and the British Museum in the 18th century; and discusses how \u2018museums\u2019 were contextualized first in Japan and later on in China. \u00a0\u00a03 Curatorship I: Exhibiting Authenticity and Interpretation\u00a0As the last lecture recalls, \u2018Museum as Ritual\u2019 has become an established social understanding\u2014museum is a place where esteemed objects are being exhibited and therefore recognized. The first problem that encounters all museum works is whether the objects they are showing, or the theme of the objects that they are presenting are \u2018authentic\u2019. In this lecture, we will look at examples of some early colonial museums and study the created themes that they presented. \u00a0\u00a04 Curatorship II: Organizing a thematic exhibition\u00a0Putting up a thematic exhibition (alongside the permanent exhibition) is a common practice in most museums. This lecture will give instructions as to what elements a thematic show should include. Then students are organized into groups to do a role play session for three parties: museum workers, overseas collaborators, and the donors. From this exercise, students will learn about the difficulties in negotiations and planning. \u00a0\u00a05 Curatorship III: Museum publications and cultural writings\u00a0The writings published for the museums share a common theme of identifying the artistic or historical values of the objects. In practice, however, there are various levels in addressing objects through literary practices. This lecture will look into some representative examples written for different targeted groups, which include children, pupils, and foreign visitors. \u00a0\u00a06 Museum and society I: Architecture and Design\u00a0Renovation projects were undertaken in numerous renowned museums around the world, because it has become aware that museums have to catch up with young generations and with the rapidly developed cities, in which they are located. This lecture will look into the case of Doha Quarter, where the locals took a deliberate attempt to a museum compound. From such we will consider the significance of architecture and museum collection. \u00a0\u00a07 Museum and society II: Education and Application of Digital Technology \u00a0Smartphones and other technological devices have become useful sources for museum presentations and visits. This lecture reviews some applications both within the museum building and outside it. The lecture will also respond to the concerns that digital technologies may exhaust public interests in the museum collections. With these both sides of argument, this lecture leads students to consider both the usefulness and shortcomings of digital technologies. \u00a0\u00a08 Museum and society III: Patrons, Donors and Volunteers, the sources of Funding and Support\u00a0Funding is always limited for cultural institutions. In this lecture, we will discuss the various potential fund sources for the museums. There is no standard way in the industry as to what the museum workers should do or write to apply for funding. But there are recognized sources about which they could get in touch: public visitors, membership programmes, volunteers, donars, and governmental resources. The key of the lecture is to develop an open mind to expand the coverage of funding from monetary values to public recognition. \u00a0\u00a09 Current issue I: Museum Branding and Marketing\u00a0Museum branding has been identified as a major marketing strategy for cultural institution. In this lecture, we will look at the suggestions of some successful museum workers and study their marketing approaches by creating a brand for museums. \u00a0\u00a010 Current issue II: Soft Power and the Political Roles of Museums.\u00a0As soon as Joseph Nye published his idea about soft power, which is based on the dissemination of cultural products or ideas, the discussion is always concerned with museum exhibitions. Museums could be taken as political statement of national treasures. In this lecture, we will discuss the ideas of Nye and look at how such concept has been interpreted in Asia. \u00a0\u00a011 Fieldtrip/site visit week \u00a0This week we will take some fresh air by visiting a local museum/site. \u00a0\u00a012 Current issue III: Museums and Contemporary Arts. \u00a0Should we include contemporary art in the context of museum? This is a difficult question that happens to most museums around the world. The well-used resolution is construction of a new venue dedicated to contemporary arts. The differences between the two disciplines\u2014museums and contemporary arts\u2014are related to the level of curatorship and public recognition. But the two themes seem to have blurred since the last decade. \u00a0\u00a013 Current issue IV: M+ and other museums in Hong Kong\u00a0In this last session, we will return our discussion to Hong Kong and look at what options this city has in comparison from what we have seen in other parts of the world. The M+ is dedicated to contemporary arts, or experimental arts; but the local museums remain fairly traditional in terms of collection and their range of exhibitions. Can Hong Kong develop a cultural hub? If so, what roles do these institutes would play?", "required_readings": "Topic 1: \u00a01. Burcaw, chapters 1 and 3. \u00a0\u00a0Topic 2:\u00a01.

Successful culture managers work to maintain healthy balance between culture and its relevant fields of interests, which sometimes could turn harmful or beneficial to the growth and development of the corresponding cultural area. The first session discusses the mutual dependence between culture and various areas, which include laws, economy, community, national interests, and art practitioners. In practice, cultural managers usually have to conform to the values and ethnics of the corresponding countries. For that reason, the second session will look at the approach taken in a few remarkable examples, which Taiwan, China, Singapore, South Korea, U.K., and the U.S.", "outcome": "Upon completion of the course, students will be able to explain different national and social concerns for preserving culture; to identify the legal and ethnic issues relevant to cultural productions; to identify marketing strategies in cultural promotion; to evaluate the measures for maximizing the input of art practitioners; and to describe the various successful cultural schemes implemented in overseas countries.", "syllabus": "Section I: Culture in Context \u00a0\u00a01. Culture & States\u00a0The growth of cultural industries is strongly related to political environment and state policy. This lecture discusses the tension and mutual expectations between cultural workers and politicians. It will use the experience of the European Union and the US as examples. \u00a0\u00a02. Culture & Laws\u00a0Over the last few decades, there were a number of remarkable disputes over international art transactions and copy rights. Given the growing size of the art market, knowledge about the previous cases is essential. This lecture takes the examples taken from the US for discussions. \u00a0\u00a03. Culture & UNESCO\u00a0UNESCO is arguably a rising new power in forming a standard for evaluating cultural heritage of different nations. This lecture discusses the roles of UNESCO and its work in different cultural disciplines. National disputes over ownership of World Heritage sites will be bought up. \u00a0\u00a04. Culture & Community\u00a0Nowadays many nations and countries perceive culture and heritage as means to empower developing communities. This lecture discusses the conservation of indigenous or minorities cultures, and its impacts on the majority population of the same community. \u00a0\u00a05. Culture & Marketing \u00a0Culture and business are often taken as two contrasting disciplines. One of the key issues in cultural management is to develop cultural audience with both education and economic concerns. Religious sectors are a growing body of cultural venues for tourism and heritage management. This lecture discusses the debated concerns about conducting marketing or business-driven strategies in cultural and religious areas. \u00a0\u00a0Section II: Case Studies\u00a06. Cultural Management in Taiwan\u00a0Taiwan provides an excellent example to demonstrate the top-down organization of heritage sites. This lecture reviews a series of campaigns launched in Taiwan during the past twenty years, and discusses the reasons that may have contributed to engage the mass of Taiwan into different aspects of cultural industries. \u00a0\u00a07. Cultural Management in China\u00a0China represents many upcoming opportunities in cultural management. This lecture reviews some recent moves: rapid establishment of museums, growing number of commercial galleries and auction houses, rise of new Confucian schools, introduction of university degrees in cultural management, etc. The lecture discusses the consuming force underneath the cultural growth in the Mainland. \u00a0\u00a08. Cultural Management in Singapore\u00a0During the last two decades, the government of Singapore invested heavily on constructing cultural venues for both national and economic purposes. This lecture gives an overview of their establishment and invites students to reflect on the opportunities found in other areas of Asia. \u00a0\u00a09. Cultural Management in South Korea\u00a0This lecture discusses the contemporary cultural policies undertaken in South Korea. During the last decade, South Korea featured an economic miracle in Asia by rejuvenating the distressed financial market with cultural developments, which included the film industry, heritage protection, publication, and cultural tourism. \u00a0\u00a010. Cultural Management in UK\u00a0The United Kingdom was one of the earliest countries that invested heavily on promotion of cultural and arts events. This lecture gives a short history of the early developments made in the UK after the Second World War, and discusses the recent campaigns undertaken to break the boundaries between high arts and popular culture. \u00a0\u00a011. Cultural Management in USA\u00a0The United States distinguishes herself from all other countries by boosting the absence of a ministry for arts and culture, yet artists and cultural workers receive due respects for their contributions. This lecture looks at the case of the US and examines her success in cultural management. \u00a0\u00a012. Group presentation\u00a0This lecture is taken as a mock symposium for students to present their group projects and make comments on those by their peers. The presentation will be evaluated against the clarity and thoughts over the approved topics. \u00a0\u00a013. Conclusion: What is the best for Hong Kong? \u00a0This last session will summarize the topics covered throughout the course. Hong Kong is facing the challenge that many aspects of cultural developments in relation to urban planning, legislation, economy, national identity, and education are all pending. This lecture is an open discussion for students to brainstorm the possible approaches that Hong Kong could take in years to come.", "required_readings": "Week 1\u00a0Rosenstein, Carole. \u2018 Cultural policy and the political nature of culture\u2019 in J.P.

It comprises three blocks: Block 1 unfolds an overall picture of the phenomenon, introduces the related concepts, displays the disciplinary foundation of this topic, traces its history, and discusses the rationales and developing tendency. Block 2 studies the urban sociological and economic approaches employed in developing the theoretical foundation, highlighting a transition in capitalist production mode and urban governance upheld by public-private partnership modes. Criticisms are also presented to complete a dialectic mindset of this phenomenon. With a strong practical dimension, Block 3 teaches students various methods to make consultancy and policy recommendations for culture-led urban development projects. A variety of practices that constitute the culture-led strategy are discussed, such as how to plan for a creative city and cultural facilities, how to boost creative industries and develop cultural quarters and creative clusters, as well as how to revitalize historic quarters.", "outcome": "Students are introduced to the basic concept of the culture-led urban development phenomenon, recognizing related concepts, understanding its history, and developing tendencies in the world. Then, they can gain a deep theoretical understanding of the origins of these practices in a capitalist political economic transition, the corresponding urban policies, and the urban governance modes. Moreover, students can learn how to conduct policy analysis and apply urban planning and design principles to provide consultancy for culture-led city development projects. The final products of group projects shall consist of policy recommendations and project consultancies for the Hong Kong government or other private sector developers.", "syllabus": "Part 1: Introduction to the Culture-led City Development Phenomenon\u00a01. Culture-led City Development: A Topic of Popularity\u00a0With a glimpse into a number of cities in Europe, America, and Asia that have implemented culture-led urban regeneration strategies, this lecture aims to spark the students\u2019 initial interest in this global phenomenon. This lecture identifies the disciplinary foundations of the topic\u2014from cultural studies, economic geography, and urban sociology to urban planning and design. Furthermore, this lecture examines the concept of culture in the culture-led city development phenomenon, emphasizing the increasing importance of culture in the related disciplines in the mindset of \u201cculture determining.\u201d The role of culture in generating profits, jobs, and other economic returns, being interwoven with local governance and identity is discussed. \u00a0\u00a02. Concepts, History, Rationale, and Debate\u00a0This section introduces a set of concepts closely related to that of \u201cculture-led city development,\u201d such as \u201ccities of culture,\u201d \u201cproperty-led development\u201d and \u201cculture-led regeneration,\u201d and differentiates the nuances among these concepts. The theories that argue for the role of culture in city formation and urban development are discussed, in which culture is viewed as resource or capital leading to symbolic economy that valorizes cities. A related issue is the role of cultural planning, which offers the resources and the framework in the process. The other theoretical source under scrutiny in this section is the importance of city or an urban environment to the growth of culture and cultural consumption. The writings of Jane Jacobs, Sharon Zukin, and Grame Evans are introduced. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss selected readings. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Part 2: Urban Sociological and Economic Approach to Understanding Culture-led Urban Regeneration\u00a03. Politics, Cultural Policies, and Culture-led City Development Strategies \u00a0This section explores the theoretical foundation of the culture-led city development phenomenon within the context of political economy. The transition of the capitalist production mode from Fordist economy to market-led post-Fordist economy has led to corresponding transitions in urban policies and urban governance modes, as well as to the adoption of public-private partnership. Culture-led city development strategy is a strategy, which is in line with the entrepreneurial urban policies. In addition, this section examines the connection between the culture-led city development strategies and the transformed cultural policies in cities. The broadening of the policy focus from art amenity provision to cultural economy development and urban cultural spaces planning has been identified as the most important policy context. Three stages of culture-led urban regeneration in terms of policies are also explained in detail. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss selected readings.\u00a0\u00a04. Economy of Culture and Arts in Cities \u00a0This section discusses the economic importance of culture and arts in cities. Culture is viewed as a new driver in urban economic growth, and the cultural sector is viewed as an indicator of urban economic growth. The economic importance of culture is associated with the so-called \u201csymbolic economy\u201d in cities, which involves upgrading urban images and boosting cultural consumption (e.g., urban tourism) within specific urban economies. Cultural and creative industries are the other main focal points of this lecture; thus, the geographic dimensions of cultural and creative industries are explored in this section. Furthermore, this lecture elaborates on the characteristics of cultural industry businesses and organizations, the geographic distribution of networks, and their production and consumption modes. Finally, a method to measure cultural and creative industries in cities is introduced. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss selected readings. \u00a0\u00a05. Culture-led Urban Regeneration Regimes and Cultural Strategies\u00a0Bianchini divides cultural culture-led city development strategies into culture-production-led and culture-consumption-led regeneration approaches. This section explores four types of production-led regeneration regimes and the consumption-led regime mode; cultural strategies and their interactions with modes of cultural production are also discussed. In addition, this section addresses the question of whether cultural strategies affect the conditions of cultural production. Finally, a method to fund cultural strategies is studied.\u00a0Tutorial: Discuss selected readings. \u00a0\u00a06. Urban Governance and Partnership Modes in Culture-led City Development \u00a0What are the urban governance modes that match individual culture-led city development practices? The transformation of urban governance and partnership modes, which is a response to the change in the capitalist production mode, is an important issue in understanding of culture-led urban development practices. Partnership is not simply a transition from managerial to entrepreneurial form but a public sector-led management to local public-private partnership to manage their opportunities effectively in the global economic background. This section explores the characteristics of urban governance and public-private partnership. This knowledge can be applied in creating cultural quarters, CCJQs, and cultural facilities in Block 3. \u00a0Tutorial: Discuss selected readings.\u00a0\u00a07. Critiques on Culture-led Urban Regeneration\u00a0Culture-led urban development strategies result in positive urban outcomes; however, they can also have negative impacts. This section presents the criticisms against culture-led urban development. For example, designation and zoning of cultural quarters often lead to the gentrification effect that cuts off poor artists from industrial studios. Flagship cultural facilities have a high chance of failure, often resulting in social exclusion and economic inequality and trigger tensions between cultural diversity and cultural hegemony. Moreover, the contribution of cultural projects to employment and GDP is questioned.\u00a0Tutorial: Discuss selected readings. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Part 3: Strategies and Mechanisms for Practice: Policies, Urban Planning, and Design Tools\u00a08. Cultural Planning and Creative Cities \u00a0This section introduces the concept of \u201ccultural planning\u201d as well as its goals, principles, and rationale for practice. The major steps for practice are discussed briefly. The second issue in this lecture is related to creative city and creative milieu. Based on the concept of \u201ccreative city\u201d introduced in CUMT1001, this lecture discusses the principles and methods to create a creative milieu for a city. Further discussions are based on the insights of Landry regarding the components of creative cities and Hall about the characteristics and preconditions for the creation of creative cities. \u00a0Mid-term Test\u00a0\u00a09. Boosting Cultural and Creative Industries in Cities \u00a0This section discusses a method of using policy and planning tools to boost cultural and creative industries in cosmopolitan cities. First, the three stages of cultural industry development in connection with cultural policy transformations in history are reviewed. Second, a method is introduced, by which policies for cultural and creative industry development can be designed and initiated. Sophisticated analyses of local resources of arts, cultural industries and their interconnections, along with production chain linkage and planning assessment, comprise the key steps in creating effective policy designs. The geographic convergence of cultural businesses and creative industry undertakings in the form of clustering has been argued to be a possible mechanism to facilitate the growth of cultural and creative industries. Finally, the principles and methods to generate CCJQs using policy and planning methods are outlined in this section.\u00a0Tutorial: Draft a proposal aimed at transforming Hong Kong into a creative city.\u00a0\u00a010. Planning for Public Arts, Arts Amenities, and Cultural Facilities\u00a0Developing cultural facilities through urban planning and design is an integral part of culture-led urban development. This section examines the position of arts amenities in urban policies through various historical stages, as well as the transition from emphasizing arts amenity provision to cultural facilities in urban planning. The main content of this lecture is devoted to providing instruction with regard to the ways by which to plan for cultural facilities in cosmopolitan cities, with an outline of the main approaches, such as providing cultural facilities as per the related planning codes with complementary methods of survey, designing a hierarchical system of cultural facility provision, developing facilities of mixed-use, and engaging member of the community. The anti-planning approach to creating cultural spaces is also included, the core concern of which involves a flexibly use of public and community spaces and family-centered virtual media facilities. \u00a0Tutorial: Analyze the policies of Hong Kong\u2019s cultural and creative industries, and draft policy recommendations for creative industry development in Hong Kong.\u00a0\u00a011. Creating Cultural Quarters \u00a0Cultural quarters, rooted in post-Fordist economy, have become an integral part of urban regeneration regime, which represents a transition in urban cultural policies toward a more comprehensive stage. This section discusses the political and economic importance of cultural quarters, the rationale of clustering cultural activities and creative industry businesses, and the typology of cultural quarters. Students are also introduced to the strategies and principles for creating cultural quarters based on Roodhouse\u2019s writings in 2006. Urban design skills to enhance the robustness of buildings and create vibrant street spaces and pedestrian spaces are complemented to Roodhouse\u2019s principles. Possible solutions to control gentrification are also discussed using the case of Lace Market. The final part of this section presents the instructor\u2019s consultancy project for the West Kowloon Cultural District.\u00a0Tutorial: Come up with recommendations for improving cultural facilities in Hong Kong.\u00a0\u00a012. Heritage Conservation and Historic Urban Quarter Revitalization\u00a0The significance of historical buildings and urban heritage sites in making a creative urban creative milieu and the process of disseminating symbols through cultural consumption-led urban spaces have been covered by previous sections. In this section, students are introduced to the historical transition and developing tendency of historic buildings and heritage conservation from preserving individual buildings to area-based conservation. With a clarification of the meaning of historic quarters, this section focuses on the selection of appropriate approaches or strategies that can be used in revitalizing historic urban quarters. These methods include preservation and conservation controls as well as physical and economic revitalization based on the assessment of the type of obsoletion. \u00a0Tutorial: Consultancy report for a cultural district in Hong Kong\u00a0\u00a013. The Workshop: Making Culturally Reenergized Cities\u00a0In this section, the final group is expected to present their group project on historical quarter revitalization in Hong Kong. To wrap up this course, the final section summarizes all the key issues and points. Supplemental instructions are provided based on the progress of the students\u2019 group projects, after which all comments on each group\u2019s projects are synthesized. One or two mechanisms might be introduced to strengthen the students\u2019 capacity to apply the theories learned, such as the evaluation matrix for cultural quarters and historic building reuses. A Q&A section is then included to answer students\u2019 questions concerning the knowledge in this course. Moreover, additional supervision for individual group projects is provided as needed.", "required_readings": "Bell, D. and Jayne, M. 2004.

Introduction: the Unseen Impacts of Museums \r\u00a0Museums make impacts in our societies in many ways, but they are usually gone unnoticed, almost unseen.

Oral Histories I\r\u00a0Not everything in the museum is tangible. In many cases, the objects are reminders of something unheard, unseen, or even almost forgotten. Oral histories are a common way to preserve the dying records. This lecture introduces the practice of building oral history records, and get students to develop their set of questions to preserve extinguishing cultural practices or knowledge. \r\u00a0Reading:\r\u00a0a.

The \u2018Branch\u2019 Strategy \r\u00a0Gugong (The Palace Museum) is going to set up a branch in Hong Kong. The branch strategy, however, is not a new thing. It began in the 1980s, when a number of century-old museums considered expansion and revenue-raising. This lecture reviews the many successful and unsuccessful cases in the past.

We will test the usefulness of the training package as suggested by ICOM and reflect on its rationale to run the museum as incorporation. \r\u00a0UNESCO Running a Museum: A Practical Handbook, available online.\r\u00a011. Training II: museum non-curatorial workers\r\u00a0Curators are usually not the first person a visitor sees or gets in touch with in the museum. There are receptionists, volunteers, security guards, caretakers, cafe waiters, etc. These people are parts of the museum. Together their bonding represents the brand of the museum. This lecture will again use the ICOM package and check the training programmes suggested in there.\r\u00a0UNESCO Running a Museum: A Practical Handbook, available online.\r\u00a012. Museum Facilities \r\u00a0Cloakrooms, washrooms, disabled facilities, restaurants, and rest areas are essential in a museum nowadays. There is also the space outside the museum building. What are the potentials of fully utilizing those space for the purpose of building a coherent institution? \r\u00a0Readings:\r\u00a0a.

Second, it will help students develop the preliminary idea of applying theories to answering research questions.

The literature review should include the mainstream knowledge for doing cultural management in a specialized area, the nature of the management process, and the political, economic, and organizational contexts, in which cultural management is done. \r\u00a0A research topic or focus will be developed based on the observation and interest of the students. The students should seek the advice of the supervisor in deciding the topic or focus, and in doing the succeeding research design. Materials covered under research design include problem identification, hypothesis generation, and major issue and concept. The supervisor will also advise students about the basic qualitative and quantitative research methods, such as statistical methods, interview, and participatory observation, appropriate to developing a conceptual framework. Alternatively, students may identify a social phenomenon pertinent to cultural management or a cultural phenomenon represented by artistic or intellectual works. Students will be encouraged to apply computer-programming techniques covered in related courses. \r\u00a0Students who participate in faculty directed research projects may have the opportunity to avail of partial or full funding for their research and field trips depending on the funding situation. Their work should contribute to the research projects of their supervisors. The students will be advised on how to fulfill the required research tasks and improve their academic writing techniques. \r\u00a0This research project will lead to the completion of a thesis or its equivalent, and further studies at the graduate level.

The duration of the internship is six to eight weeks and it is normally full-time work (240-320 hours), subject to the agreement with the corresponding party. There might be exceptional cases in which students are engaged in part-time internship programmes held during the academic year because of the scheduling of specific arts projects.\r\u00a0During the internship, students are expected to maximize the opportunities to access the staff, board meetings, internal and cross-organizational communications, in order to develop the understanding of the operation of the organization through participatory observation. To enhance on-job professional experience, the students are expected to complete professional management tasks independently or as a member of the agency\u2019s management team with maximized exposure to the entire management process. The students\u2019 internship will be largely in the charge of a field supervisor in the agency. It is important to have adequate on-job supervision that clarifies the policies and job requirements. The student\u2019s supervisor in the Programme will provide advices regarding how to prepare the students for the working environment, carry out on-site observations, and write the final report. The Programme endorses the students\u2019 full-time/part-time internships to fulfill the requirement for the BA degree. \r\u00a0\u00a0List of available organizations will be announced and interviews arranged normally three to four months prior to actual participation of internship, Students are required to identify three options of organizations, with advices from the internship panel. Arrangement will be made for interviews and the final decisions are to be made by the organizations.\r\u00a0 Option is opened for students to suggest organizations that are not of the list provided by the Programme. The suggested organizations must meet the following criteria: 1) Confirmed interest in offering internship; 2) Established organization with proper operational office, full time staff and creditable reputation; 3) Could provide a safe and proper learning/working environment; 4) No possible conflict of interest or personal linkage that might affect the final assessment. Based on the above criteria, the internship panel would make decision regarding the inclusion of the organizations into the internship programme. \r\u00a0\u00a0Students are urged to timely hand in copies of documentary outputs, if any, of the intern employment, or reports prepared as a part of their internship experience. Arrangement for discussions with their Programme supervisors regarding the internship experience and critiques is encouraged. Students\u2019 performance during the intern should be assessed by their field supervisors. A reviewing letter from the supervisor should be submitted, which contributes to the students\u2019 final grades. In addition to the field supervisors\u2019 assessment, students\u2019 final report and a presentation open to the university are required and will be graded. \r\u00a0In case the student prefers academic pursuit or has tried and failed to obtain an internship, the student may consider conducting an individual research project or participating in faculty-directed research projects as specified in \u201cCUMT4102 Research Project.\u201d", "required_readings": "Baird, B.N.
