It is the key element of the programme intended to extend student\u2019s knowledge and understanding of one particular discipline in a more in-depth level, which may not be possible by undertaking taught post-graduate courses. Besides, it provides the opportunity for the student to specialise in a particular area of study in line with the student\u2019s career interests and aspirations. Student is expected to satisfactorily complete a basic research training and undertake a substantial piece of independent work, which is a more advanced and intensive study than a first degree, in not less than 12 months, and present a satisfactory thesis.\u00a0\u00a0Upon completion of the research project, student will be able to display and demonstrate the following abilities and expertise:\u00a0\u2022 asking critical questions;\u00a0\u2022 effectively reviewing literature for likely answers to the queries;\u00a0\u2022 putting up hypotheses;\u00a0\u2022 designing vigorous testings of the conjectures; \u00a0\u2022 being competent to investigate the specific subjects;\u00a0\u2022 being able to focus on unique issues;\u00a0\u2022 undertaking independent research;\u00a0\u2022 effectively working with research collaborators and colleagues;\u00a0\u2022 complying to medical ethics and the importance of good research practice;\u00a0\u2022 meticulously analysing and evaluating research data;\u00a0\u2022 presenting information both orally and in written form to a professional standard.", "syllabus": " A minimum of 40 \u2013 50 hours of bench work.However, experimental hurdles are not easily solved and hardly predictable, a longer time might be required in many situations.
