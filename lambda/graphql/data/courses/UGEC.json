It aims to deepen understanding the following three facets of Japanese popular culture:1) the applicaton of cultural globalization theory in Japan; 2) the global strategy of Japanese cultural industries; and 3) social and intellectual transformation of contemporary Japanese society. Using concrete examples and grounding on representative academic writings, this course discusses the globalization of Japanese popular culture and relevant issues in indigenization, glocalization, hybridization, transnational cultural flows and media-mix.

Having taken this course, students will be equipped with a basic ability to analyse cultural phenomenon in the lens of such cultural concepts as indigenization, glocalization, hybridization, transnational cultural flows, media mix, cultural colonialism and orientalism.", "syllabus": "Main Objective:This main purpose of course is to examine the global popularization and localization of Japanese popular culture from historical, cultural and comparative perspectives within the theoretical framework of cultural globalization. It aims to indicate that the cultural flows between Japan and Asia are by no means one-way traffic and Asia has been interacting and collaborating with the Japanese in creating, manufacturing, marketing and distributing cultural products for decades. Lectures, discussions and readings highlight different facets of cultural acculturation and transnational interaction found in Japan-Asia cross-cultural flows, such as appropriation, hybridization, global localization business strategy, the making of localized editions, the local application of Japanese formula, joint production, and the participation of foreign artists and staff. Solidly grounding on empirical data as well as theories from cultural globalization and cross-cultural studies, this course will be a pioneering teaching and learning project to explore uncharted research territories in Japanese studies, Japan-Hong Kong relations, and cultural studies.\u00a0Key Issues and Problems:The following key issues and problems regarding the globalization of Japanese popular culture in an Asian context will be addressed in this course within the theoretical fiarnework of cultural globalization:\u00a01) The idea that the influx of Japanese cultural products is a form of cultural imperialism that aims to expand Japanese economic interest and to spread Japanese value and lifestyle in Asia will be empirically and theoretically reexamined and challenged. It shows that cultural imperialism is an outdated model in cross-cultural studies, because it fails to understand the dynamic mechanism in transnational cultural flows and cultural forces of localization and hybridization.2) While using \"glocalization\" (Roland Robertson uses it to refer to the localization strategy employed by multi-national companies to promote their products in different nations) to investigate the global business strategy of Japanese companies such as Sony, Nintendo, Capcom and Bandai in Asian and global markets, this course underscores the limitation of the glocalization theory in the East Asian context, as it fails to see the initiative taken by Asian artists and businessmen to creatively and selectively domesticate Japanese elements.3) This course uses Japanese popular culture as a mirror or text to decode social and cultural issues of contemporary Japan. For examples, themes about ethnicity, gender, social hierarchy, political ideology, and cultural identity will be examined in the lens of Japanese popular culture.\u00a0Core Content, Structure and Selected Topics:The course content of this course investigates the three facets of Japanese popular culture: (1) the application of cultural globalization theory in Japan, (2) the global strategy of Japanese cultural industries, (3) social and intellectual transformation of contemporary Japanese society. Accordingly, its structure follows the design of core content and contains the following three parts:\u00a0Part 1: Japanese Popular Culture and Cultural Globalization: Theories and PracticesSelected Topics:(a) Introduction to Basic Theories in Cultural Studies and Cultural Globalization(b) Globalization of Japanese Popular Culture in an Asian Context(c) Reexamining the Cultural Imperialism, Orientalism and Nihonjinron\u00a0 Discourses(d) Indigenization and Hybridization of Japanese Popular Culture in Asia (1) Food and Fashion(e) Indigenization and Hybridization of Japanese Popular Culture in Asia (2) TV Programs\u00a0Part 2: Interplay between Globalization and JapanesenessSelected Topics:(a) Nihonjinron in Japanese Movies and Alternative Mode of Globalization(b) The Formation of Japanese Manga and Anime and Their Hybridity(c) The Making of an Otaku Culture in Japan and Beyond(d) The Adaptation of Chinese Tradition in Japanese popular culture\u00a0Part 3: The Global Strategy of Japanese Cultural IndustriesSelected Topics:(a) Glocalization of Japanese Video Games and Cyber Culture(b) Transnational Collaboration and Cross-cultural Themes in Japanese Movies(c) Japaneseness and Universality in Japanese Comics and Animated Series(d) Exporting and Domesticating Japanese Formula in Asian Drama and Music(e) Media-mix as a Business Strategy in Japanese Cultural Industries\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "required_readings": "1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Koichi Iwabuchi, Recentering Globalization: Popular Culture and Japanese Transnationalism (Duke UP, 2002), chapters 1-3, 5.2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 D.

Students are expected to understand the relationship between the language expressions and the behaviors of Japanese people in various circumstances and the reasons behind such behaviors.\u00a03. Through comparing the culture of Japan with that of Hong Kong, students will become able to make comments on the characteristics of each and distinguish between the two.\u00a04.

The usage and the characteristics of Japanese language will also be discussed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 2\u00a0Lesson 2\u00a0Introduction to the historical changes of kanji and kana in the Japanese language:\u00a0This lesson explains the historical changes of kanji and kana in Japanese language. Focus will be on why Japanese absorbed Chinese characters into their writing system and the process of how Chinese characters were converted to the modern kana (hiragana and katakana).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 3 \u2013 Week 4\u00a0Lesson 3\u00a0Introduction to the phrases expressing linguistic politeness:\u00a0This lesson briefly explains the phrases expressing linguistic politeness. These include honorific expressions, expressions used in making requests, making apologies, expressing gratitude and personal opinions, giving advice and asking for permission. Emphasis will be placed on when and how these expressions are used. The relationship between such expressions and the characteristics of hierarchy in Japanese society will also be discussed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 4 - 5\u00a0Lesson 4\u00a0Strategies used in making requests and refusals in Japanese: \u00a0This lesson discusses how Japanese make requests and refuse the requests of others. Such expressions are often used in daily life by Japanese but are not easily understood by foreigners. Special attention will be given to: \u00a0a. the difference in behaviour between Japanese and non Japanese in making requests and refusals.\u00a0b. how this behaviour reflects characteristics of Japanese culture. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 6 \u2013 Week 7\u00a0Lesson 5\u00a0Strategies used in making apologies and taking responsibility:\u00a0This lesson discusses how Japanese apologize and take responsibility after misconduct such as scandals or accidents. For example, we often see the top management of Japanese companies bow to the public to apologize for their misconduct and they may even quit the company in order to take responsibility for problems. In Hong Kong, it is rare to see such a phenomenon. We will discuss the mechanism of how Japanese make an apology and the effect of the Japanese way of apologizing upon social situations. Special attention will be given to the comparison of the styles of apology in Japanese and Hong Kong societies. We will also discuss the relationship between the Japanese way of apologizing and issues related to the Sino-Japanese War.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 8 \u2013 Week 9\u00a0Lesson 6\u00a0Ambiguity in the Javanese language:\u00a0Compared with other languages such as Chinese, there are many ambiguous linguistic practices in Japanese. These include, for example, the deletion of the subject \"watashi\" (I), the use of \"koto ni\u00a0narimashita\" (become something) rather than \"koto ni shimashita\" (I decided to do something) when talking about personal matters such as getting married, and the frequent use of intransitive verbs rather than transitive verbs. Most Japanese language learners including Hong Kong learners have experienced difficulties with these expressions and practices in their learning process. We will analyze and comment on this phenomenon.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 9 \u2013 Week 10\u00a0Lesson 7\u00a0The Business Manner of Japanese:\u00a0This lesson discusses how Japanese behave in business negotiations. Japanese are often criticized for not stating their true feelings and opinions. They often use expressions such as \"kangaesasetekudasai\" (Please let me think about it), \"kekkoo desu\" (It's O.K. /No, thank you) to indirectly express their opinions. We will discuss why Japanese behave in such a way and the correct way to deal with a Japanese business partner.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 10 - Week 11 \u00a0Lesson 8\u00a0Japanese language in a sociolinguistic perspective:\u00a0In this lesson we discuss the following items of importance in sociolinguistics as they appear in the Japanese language.\u00a0a. the comparison between written and colloquial styles\u00a0b. the comparison of language usage for men and women\u00a0c. the comparison between the standard language and dialect\u00a0d. the comparison of language usage between the young and the elderly\u00a0e. the comparison between formal styles and informal styles\u00a0f. the comparison between jargon and standard expressions\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 12\u00a0Lesson 9\u00a0The success and failure in learning Javanese language (with a focus on Hong Kong Cantonese speaking learners):\u00a0First, we will give a brief introduction to the theories of second language acquisition. Next, the factors affecting the results of the process of second language learning will be discussed. To ensure a better understanding, case studies comparing English language acquisition among Japanese and Hong Kong people will be introduced. Finally, by summarizing the above observations and the characteristics of both Japanese and Cantonese, we will comment on the difficulties experienced by Hong Kong Cantonese speaking Japanese learners.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 13\u00a0Lesson 10\u00a0Special topics on Japanese 1anguage and Japanese culture: \u00a0Special topics will be selected to help students understand the relationship between Japanese language and culture.\u00a0a. \"shin go ryuukoogo taishoo\" (New words and buzz terms Grand Prix)\u00a0b. \"kotoshi no kanji\" (The Chinese character of this year)\u00a0\u00a0", "required_readings": "Lesson 1\u00a0Introduction to Japanese culture:\u00a01 Gottlieb, Nanette.

Moreover, cross-border film studies have become an important avenue of understanding globalization. It is within such context that this course aims to expose students to a global perspective for understanding movies of China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan), Japan and Korea by comparing some common themes represented in movies of these countries. This course consists of four major parts focusing on the comparative studies of Chinese, Japanese and Korean cinemas: (1) Nostalgia in Romantic Movies, (2) Historical Trauma in Violent Movies, (3) Images of Women in Women-Centered Films, and (4) Urban Images in Movies Based on Cities. These themes are chosen for their significances of reflecting the recent history of colonization or decolonization, and the experience of modernization in these East Asian societies. Through the above comparative studies, students will learn how different cultures maintain their uniqueness in an era of globalization; and how these topics have been differently interpreted and visualized by the post-war generation of each region. This course emphasizes interdisciplinary research and study methods, including film criticism, history and cultural studies. The lecturer will commence each lesson by referring to academic readings, and show film clips if necessary, to serve as the basis for in-class discussions.\r", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "1302", "title": "Understanding Japanese Culture and Society Through Movies", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Office of University GE", "requirements": "UGEC1302 is double-coded with JASP1140. ;Not for Japanese Studies Majors; and students who have taken GESC2080, JASP1140 or 1150. ;Co-requisite: UGFH1000, UGFN1000 or UGFN1001 (only applicable to students admitted to the 4-year curriculum)", "description": "(UGEC1302 is double-coded with JASP1140.)

Students in this course will learn how to apply the fundamental economic principles to almost every aspect of their life.\u00a0Week\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topic1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rationality, What, When, How, Whom2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Demand and Supply Theory3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Demand and Supply Application: Marriage4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Demand and Supply Application: Crime5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Demand and Supply Application: Rent Control6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measuring Economic Performance: National Income Accounting7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Measuring Economic Performance: Inflation and Unemployment8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Money Creation and Banking System9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Monetary and Fiscal Policy10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trade and WTO11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contribution by Nobel Laureates\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "required_readings": "Suggested Textbooks:Heyne, P.,P.

These theories were selected because of their direct relevance for developing an understanding of modern government behaviour. \u00a0 Public administration is often considered in a managerial manner, as little more than control and straightforward analysis of efficiency and economy. This is not necessarily the case. People from different walks of life tend to have different expectations of government. This course is intended to foster a change in attitudes among students. After the course, students are expected to have the ability and tendency to think critically from multidisciplinary perspectives and to provide a critical appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of any theoretical approach. Most important of all, by taking this course, students should have developed an understanding of the basic concepts and theories in public administration and should have gained the ability to apply them to the context of Hong Kong. Public administration, as an area of study, is very much a study based in American context. Therefore, it is important for students to reflect on the concepts and approaches covered in the course, and to consider how they can contribute to a better understanding of public administration in Hong Kong. The course is intended to reinforce communication skills on the part of students. Through the training in debates and discussions, students should have developed the ability to convey abstract ideas and complicated issues in a concrete and organized manner.", "syllabus": "Teaching Plan and Readings (* required readings)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Part I.

It will cover history and political ideologies in North Korea, North Korean economic reform and the development of underground economy, policy of nuclear brinkmanship, controversial issues of human rights violations, North Korean defectors and the inter-Korean relations, art and propaganda in North Korea, North Korea travel and tourism development, and also sports and nationalism in North Korea.\r", "outcome": " Course Objectives: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Student will learn theory of military dictatorship regime, mad-man theory and theory of nuclear proliferation.

Module 2: Drug Effects Chapter 3&4 Addictive Drugs: Alcohol and Heroin These two chapters introduce two highly addictive drugs, namely alcohol and heroin. We discuss their cultural consumption and harmful effects and how institutional mechanisms in different societies regulate these drugs. Chapter 5&6 Psychoactive Drugs: Marijuana and LSD These two chapters discuss the controversy over drug legalization, particularly marijuana and LSD. We discuss the effects of these drugs and whether their medical and/or recreational use should be legalized. Module 3: Drug Prevention and Treatment Chapter 7&8 Drug Scene in Hong Kong and China These two chapters discuss the changing drug use patterns in Hong Kong and China and examine how these changes are interweaved with an array of social factors, such as migration and economic development. Chapter 9&10 The War on Drugs vs. Harm Reduction These two chapters introduce the common two approaches to handling drug use issues in a society: zero tolerance and harm reduction. We discuss the effectiveness of these two approaches. Chapter 11&12 Health Consequences of Drug Taking These two chapters discuss the associated risks of drug taking, including HIV/AIDS and HCV contraction. We also discuss the effectiveness of the treatment of these drug-related diseases. Various topics in relation to drugs and culture, such as cocaine use, club drug use, ketamine use, misuse of prescription drugs, and use of new pharmaceutical products, such as Prozac and Viagra, are the selected topics for this course.\u00a0", "required_readings": "\u00a0 1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction to Drugs\u00a0\u00a0 Singer, Merrill. 2006. \u201cThe Colonial Era to Drug Criminalization.\u201d In Something Dangerous: Emergent and Changing Illicit Drug Use and Community Health, pp.35-54.

Underlying most topics are questions of the modern versus the traditional, rural versus urban, cosmopolitan versus parochial, and how all these opposites interact to construct culture in Hong Kong. Hong Kong has been developed at a rapid pace since WWII. This course also discusses to what extent the development in Hong Kong meets the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular in the area of gender equality, cultural inclusiveness, and socially responsible production and consumption.

For example, aging or overpopulation in urban cities, environmental degradation, food and water resource crisis, large-scale voluntary and involuntary migration, and spread of communicable disease. A key goal of the course is to map out the linkages between population patterns, trends, and some of the socio-economic issues that occur locally, nationally, and at the global level which bring great challenges to our society. You will learn the concepts, theories, and data essential in the scientific study of the size, composition, and spatial distribution of human populations; and the changes that occur in these phenomena through the processes of fertility, mortality, and migration. You will gain an understanding of the roots of population structures, processes, and the consequences for individuals, family, and societies, and how it will affect and be affected by natural resources availability or depletion and health care system. Students will acquire the basic ability to analyze, explain and present the potential crisis facing the population system. In particular, this course will stimulate students\u2019 interest in understanding how the population could be linked to sustainable development, and reflect on the relationship between population growth and availability of resources, as well as the relationship between population and social institutional arrangements such as child and old care support, job supply and public asset distribution. In the end, students will learn to apply their skill and knowledge in proposing solutions for solving population-related challenges for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), for example, zero hunger and no poverty, good health and well-being, reducing social inequality including gender inequality, maintaining decent work and economic development while developing more sustainable cities and communities.

This course is an introduction to the formation of modernity in relation to various aspects of urban culture. Tracing the development of cities and the urban cultures evolved within the new urban development since the 19th Century, cities such as Paris, London, New York will serve as 'texts' for analysis. Architecture, urban planning, artistic and intellectual movements as well as modes of everyday life in urban living are studied to demonstrate how the modern ways of thinking, seeing and living come into being. The course will also focus on the specificity of Hong Kong's experience in urban development and its adaptation of 'modernity' during a process of urbanization. The course will employ a wide range of visual images and audio-visual materials to explain the dynamism between modernity and urban culture.", "outcome": "\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To equip students with basic theories and concepts of urban studies, modernity, cultural geography, and critical theory.\u00a0\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To equip students with critical skills in analyzing the dynamism between modernity and urban culture in relation to examples from various visual and literary genres.\u00a0\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To enable students to use interdisciplinary critical perspectives to probe different dimensions in the phenomena of urban culture\u00a0\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To provide strategies to articulate cultural theories with our practices of everyday life\u00a0\u00a0", "syllabus": "Section 1: Modernitv and New Architecture\u00a01. \u00a0Urban Planning and the Development of Cities\u00a02. \u00a0Modernity and Modernism\u00a03. \u00a0Bauhaus and the New Architecture\u00a04. \u00a0New Utopia and its Failure\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 2: Tales of Cities\u00a05. \u00a0Modern Metropolis: Paris and London\u00a06. \u00a0Modem Metropolis: Chicago, New York and Los Angeles\u00a07. \u00a0Modem Metropolis: Shanghai\u00a08. \u00a0Hong Kong: A History of Urban development\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 3: Urban Culture and the Politics of Everyday\u00a09. \u00a0Metropolis and Sub-cultures\u00a010.

The UN 2030 Agenda came into effect in 2015 promising to \u201cinterlink and integrate\u201d Sustainable Development Goals in an attempt to implement solutions facing humanity. Sustainable development goals are an all-inclusive invitation to act to end poverty, secure the planet and ensure that all people appreciate peace and prosperity.This course introduces the concept of sustainable development, the evolution of models and the implicit assumptions they make, as well as their contradictions. It also traces the advent of the SDGs and the extent that they support the principles of sustainable development. We examine the emergence of environmental problems and critically review the institutional responses to these problems since the late 1960s. We then consider in detail the increasingly popular idea of efforts in the pursuit of the SDGs from different perspectives that centres around people, planet, prosperity, peace and the partnerships involved in achieving the goals. The lectures will explore how achieving sustainable development goals will depends much on effective planning and good governance. Examples from different parts of the world will be used to underline the tight inter-connections between processes in different regions and across geographical scales in the context of sustainable development.

Because of environmental variations, some places are definitely better than the others for living and development. In the ancient time, man strived for searching a nice place for settlement which could provide a better resource base. Nowadays, man acquires sciences and technologies to change or even create the environment that makes living pleasant and comfortable. This course provides students with the insights needed to gain an understanding of ideal environment for living from a geographical perspective. Topics include environmental perception, siting and location, urbanization, land use and functions, urban planning, urban design, architecture and interior design. As the course examines the understanding of ideal environment for living from different angles, students will not only gain objective geographical knowledge about the relationship between man and environment, but also learn how some urban challenges and issues are tackled. While the coverage will be broad and pluralistic, examples and cases of mainland China and Hong Kong will be emphasized. In order to enhance the learning experience, an interactive teaching mode will be adopted in the lectures so that the instructors can guide students to analyze the cases and issues through queries and answers.\r", "outcome": "\u00a0 After taking this course, students are expected to:\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 be aware of the environmental variations around the world\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 be critical in the pursuit of better, if not ideal, environment for living\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 be familiar with the development of city and the process of urbanization\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 appreciate the beauty and aesthetics of various human settlement forms\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 realize that man must best use his environment and natural resource base on a continuing basis\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0", "syllabus": "\u00a0 This course portraits an image of ideal living environment from a geographical perspective.

Ironically, world hunger is increasing and FAO\u2019s most recent estimates put the number of hungry people at 822 million in 2018-19, an increase of more than 28 million since 2014-16, even though the technology of food production has improved significantly. Why? It is because the causes of world hunger are multiple and, in principle, include food availability, accessibility and utilization. The course therefore adopts a multidisciplinary approach to examine the different issues of food and hunger, and how they change with time. The causes of world hunger will be analyzed with special emphasis on food production systems, bearing in mind there is no single solution to the problem. Towards the end of the course, the development of sustainable agriculture and measures to mitigate the hunger problem in the 21st century will be addressed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Lectures will be supplemented with case studies, videos and slides.", "outcome": " Food is a basic need of human beings and food security is often assumed in an affluent society like Hong Kong.

The purpose of this course is to critically examine the common framing of Africa as a continent of conflict, disasters, poverty and a region that is perpetually in need of external intervention. In addition to the myth that surrounds Africa, there is a growing dynamics of activities resulting into the current interest on the continent. Earlier, the UN settled on the Agenda 2030 as a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity for the whole world. This plan dovetails very well with the Africa\u2019s Agenda 2063. This therefore provides an opportunity to identify where Africa situates on SDG issues that include its people, its environment and its economic development.The course will therefore present to students the context of Africa relating to its geography, environment, culture as well as contemporary development issues shaping the destiny of Africa. Through lectures, guest speakers, videos and possibly field studies, students will be able to critically evaluate the stereotypical notion of Africa as a continent rather than as a country as is quite often misconstrued. The course will provide an intellectual platform to understand and analyze issues from a multi-disciplinary perspective as they relate to Africa and humanity. The students will be able to interpret and explain in broad terms, the contemporary position of Africa as it relates to other parts of the world with special attention to its relationship with Asia and China in particular.", "outcome": " Through a variety of teaching and learning activities, including lectures, video shows, forum and group discussion on current issues, the student will be able to:  acquire basic knowledge of the physical, environmental and cultural geography of the African continent  embark on intellectual dialogues and critically analyze the theoretical and practical aspects of the people\u2019s relationship with the African physical environment.  students will understand the extent to which SDGs are integrated into the African development agenda  comment academically on issues, problems and challenges related to Africa.  demonstrate a greater understanding of Africa as a continent and its people;  think critically and academically in approaching the discussions on African issues  acquire the skills and capacity to provide necessary leadership and expertise to others seeking knowledge of and involvement in Africa and African affairs.", "syllabus": " 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From MDGs to SDGs: What\u2019s in it for Africa? 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction: Overview of Africa-the Place, People and Culture 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ABCDE (African biodiversity conservation, degradation and extinction on Landscapes) (SDG 14 Life on Land) 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rural and Urban development in Africa (SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities) 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Disasters, poverty and livelihood (SDG1 No Poverty/SDG2 Zero Hunger) 6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 People-land relations (SDG2 Zero Hunger/SDG 6 Clean Water and Sanitation) 7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 People \u2013 people relationship: the Role of religion (Islam and Christianity) (SDG5 Gender Equality/SDG16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institution) 8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is Africa overpopulated?/Water resources/Food security/Infrastructure (I)(SDG 6/SDG2/SDG9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) 9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is Africa overpopulated?/Water resources/Food security/Infrastructure (II) )(SDG 6/SDG2/SDG9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) 10.\u00a0 \u00a0 Africa\u2019s Emerging economy (SDG 17 Partnership for the Goals) 11.\u00a0 \u00a0 China and Africa: Historical ties and contemporary issues (SDG 17 Partnership for the Goals)\u00a0", "required_readings": " PART 1-\u00a0Physical and environmental aspects of African continent Alan de Brauw, Valerie Mueller, Hak Lim Lee (2014).

The unprecedented pace of urbanization has recently witnessed a historic shift of human population with the majority now living in cities. The growth of cities in this age of globalization raises many opportunities and challenges, concerning the quality of life, poverty, sustainability, environmental degradation and urban competitiveness. All of which deserve our attention.This course offers students a comprehensive understanding of cities and urban challenges from the perspective of sustainable development. It examines the historical, social, economic, cultural and environmental dimensions of cities. As the course focuses on urban issues at global, regional and local levels, students will not only gain knowledge about the causes and impacts of urban problems, but also learn how different stakeholders can help achieve sustainable liveable cities in the age of globalization. By adopting an issue-based approach, different SDGs such as no poverty (SDG 1), industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9), reduced inequality (SDG 10) and sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), will be included in a variety of topics ranging from socio-economic to environmental aspects in the course. Different cities will be chosen as case studies for understanding various urban challenges and solutions. Apart from lectures, students will develop critical thinking on various urban challenges that affect their daily lives through video discussion, group projects and presentation in the discussion forums.", "outcome": " This course will offer students a comprehensive understanding of cities and urban challenges.

Many scholars and activists argue that globalization will lead to a worldwide homogenized consumer culture dominated by Western values. Others believe that globalization can lead to the clashes of incorrigible cultures. Meanwhile, globalization has catalyzed formation of new hybrid cultures and fostered the blooming of creative cultural industries. In this course, we will explore the above topics through understanding the effects of globalization on personal identities, the economy, consumerism, and communication, etc. in the immediate and distal environment.\r", "outcome": " Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to: 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Describe the evolution of the globalized culture and society and identify how different factors contribute to the formulation and transformation of global culture and society; 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Understand the basic concepts, theories and analytical approaches in understanding the diversity of different cultural and social systems across the globe; 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Critically analyze the basic characteristics, process of cultural globalization and its interaction with national, regional and international society; 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Describe and analyze the roles and functions of state and non-state actors in shaping global culture and society, etc.; 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analyze the role and functions of communication, media and technology in the context of the globalized culture and society; and 6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Critically reflect the role and impacts of global capitalism on cultural globalization; \u00a0 If possible, seminar by invited guest will be arranged to provide students with insights into the debates and controversies in contemporary world economy. \u00a0", "syllabus": " Introduction \u00a0 Part I - Laying the foundation: What is globalization of culture?

This course aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to global politics, focusing in particular on its origins and historical evolution, its key concepts, major theoretical frameworks, main actors and institutions, the global architecture of power, and its dynamic nature in the process of globalization. It aims to offer students with the basic knowledge and analytical tools for making sense of current issues in global politics. It adopts a multi-disciplinary approach that integrates theoretical issues with regional case studies. The course will first offer a general survey of the key concepts and major theoretical perspectives in the study of Global Politics (Liberalism, Realism, Social Constructivism and Marxist theory, etc.). It then proceeds to cover selected topics of global politics in the areas of War and Peace and the Clash of Civilization. It focuses on how world politics is transformed by globalization, with a particular focus on its impacts on issues concerning the identity and national pride, balance of power, peace and conflicts, borders and security, etc. Finally, the course will be concluded with the discussion of latest trends of global governance, with a particular focus on the emergency of international and regional organizations. Relevant real world examples and case studies will be adopted to illustrate the big ideas and key concepts of global politics.This course intends to promote students\u2019 appreciation of the role of \u2018power\u2019, \u2018security\u2019 and \u2018justice\u2019 in shaping the global political order nowadays. Students will gain deeper insights into not only latest developments in global political affairs, but also concepts and theories useful for further studies in politics, international relations, and global political economy. The course is designed to introduce essential concepts, major theoretical perspectives and basic mechanisms of global political order, allowing students to communicate issues in world politics effectively in group work and individually, in oral as well as written forms.\r", "outcome": " Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to: \u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Describe the evolution of the global political order and identify how power relations is related to the peace and security of world politics;

Origins of the CR t to 1965  We investigate the multiple conditions and causes that produced the CR.   The Launching of the Cultural Revolution, 1966.  We examine the chain of policies and events that set the CR in motion.   Power Seizures and the rise of the Radicals, 1967  We investigate the complex sequence of events and the ways of making sense of the unique rise of Maoist radicalism and its dramatic actions.   Chaos and Military Control  We explore how to render comprehensible the chaos and violence of 1967-69 and the policies and complications to the assertion of military controls.   Sent--Down Youth and Rural China  We interrogate the abundant narratives of the Sent-down Youth experience and seek to understand commonalities and diversity to the rural manifestations of the CR coming to light in local research.   Cultural Revolution Culture  We analyze a propaganda society transformed and the logics, variant forms and uses of cultural forms once thought to be uniform.   High Maoism China's Place in the World  We investigate the regional and international tensions and isolation produced of this period as well as the inspiration it offered to global radical youth movements and visions for the future.   Cultural Revolution at the Margins  We excavate ways in which CR Maoism unleashed pressures and possibilities, restraints and inspirations that motivated social and cultural demands and creativity from the grassroots.

Through the study of popular religions in Hong Kong, this course hopes to enrich students with a better understanding of both the structure and the dynamics of Hong Kong society as well as its local culture.\r", "outcome": "\u9999\u6e2f\u6c11\u9593\u5b97\u6559\uff0c\u540c\u5b78\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u6216\u5df2\u6709\u807d\u805e\uff0c\u4f46\u4e4b\u524d\u672a\u6709\u5b78\u8853\u63a2\u8a0e\u8207\u5be6\u5730\u8003\u5bdf\u53bb\u77ad\u89e3\uff0c\u672c\u79d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6b64\u5b78\u7fd2\u5167\u5bb9\u548c\u9014\u5f91\u3002\u540c\u5b78\u901a\u904e\u5927\u8ab2\u3001\u5c0f\u7d44\u5c0e\u4fee\u53ca\u5169\u6b21\u8003\u5bdf\uff0c\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u5438\u6536\u548c\u638c\u63e1\u8ab2\u7a0b\u8981\u9ede\uff0c\u5373\u9999\u6e2f\u6c11\u9593\u5b97\u6559\u8207\u50b3\u7d71\u793e\u6703\u6587\u4eba\u4e4b\u9593\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u00a0\u8ab2\u5802\u4e0a\u8b1b\u53ca\u7684\u6c11\u9593\u5b97\u6559\u6d3b\u52d5\uff0c\u5982\u300c\u592a\u5e73\u6e05\u91ae\u8207\u5730\u57df\u793e\u6703\u300d\uff0c\u540c\u5b78\u5c0d\u5176\u6e90\u6d41\u3001\u5730\u65b9\u795e\u7947\u548c\u65cf\u7fa4\u90fd\u52a0\u4e86\u8a8d\u8b58\u3002\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5be6\u5730\u8003\u5bdf\uff0c\u540c\u5b78\u610f\u898b\u53cd\u6620\u662f\u9817\u80fd\u8207\u8ab2\u5802\u6559\u5b78\u914d\u5408\uff0c\u5f15\u8d77\u4ed6\u5011\u5c0d\u6709\u95dc\u8ab2\u984c\u7684\u8208\u8da3\u548c\u6df1\u7a76\u3002\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "syllabus": " 1.\u00a0 \u8ab2\u7a0b\u4ecb\u7d39\uff1a\u7e3d\u8ad6\uff1b\u6c11\u9593\u5b97\u6559\u7684\u6642\u3001\u5730\u3001\u795e\u3001\u4eba\u3001\u5edf\uff08\u5718\u9ad4\uff09 2.\u00a0 \u6c11\u9593\u5b97\u6559\u8207\u7bc0\u4ee4\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2 3.\u00a0 \u81ea\u7136\u795e\u5d07\u62dc\uff0c\u5f9e\u571f\u5730\u516c\u8aaa\u8d77 4.\u00a0 \u5be6\u5730\u8003\u5bdf\uff08I\uff09\uff1a\u5f35\u98db\u8a95 5.\u00a0 \u795e\u8207\u4eba\uff1a\u95dc\u5e1d\u4fe1\u4ef0\u8207\u5d07\u7940 6.\u00a0 \u795e\u8207\u4eba\uff1a\u9ec3\u5927\u4ed9\u4fe1\u4ef0\u8207\u5d07\u7940 7.\u00a0 \u5730\uff08\u7de3\uff09\uff1a\u592a\u5e73\u6e05\u91ae\u8207\u5730\u57df\u793e\u6703 8. \u00a0\u5730\uff08\u4f86\u9f8d\u53bb\u8108\uff09\uff1a\u98a8\u6c34\u8207\u805a\u843d\u9078\u5740 9. \u00a0\u8840\u7de3\u5718\u9ad4\uff1a\u7956\u5b97\u5d07\u62dc\u8207\u5b97\u65cf\u7d44\u7e54 10. \u00a0\u6276\u9e1e\u7d50\u793e\uff1a\u4e8c\u5341\u4e16\u7d00\u8208\u8d77\u7684\u6551\u4e16\u5718\u9ad4 11. \u00a0\u5be6\u5730\u8003\u5bdf\uff08II\uff09\uff1a\u6276\u9e1e\u5718\u9ad4 12. \u00a0\u696d\u7de3\u5718\u9ad4\u8207\u884c\u696d\u795e\u5728\u9999\u6e2f 13. \u00a0\u9999\u6e2f\u3001\u6fb3\u9580\u8207\u81fa\u7063\u5730\u5340\u7684\u6c11\u9593\u795e\u7947\uff1a\u5abd\u7956 14. \u00a0\u7e3d\u7d50\uff1a\u6c11\u9593\u5b97\u6559\u8207\u4e2d\u570b\u793e\u6703\u6587\u5316 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "required_readings": "\u5289\u4ef2\u5b87\u300a\u4e2d\u570b\u6c11\u9593\u4fe1\u4ef0\u8207\u9053\u6559\u300b\uff0c\u53f0\u5317\uff1a\u6771\u5927\uff0c2003\u3002\u00a0\u9673\u614e\u6176\u7de8\u300a\u8af8\u795e\u5609\u5e74\u83ef\uff1a\u9999\u6e2f\u5b97\u6559\u7814\u7a76\u300b\uff0cHong Kong: Oxford University Press, 2002.\u00a0\u674e\u4ea6\u5712\u300a\u6587\u5316\u8207\u4fee\u990a\u300b\uff0c\u81fa\u5317\uff1a\u5e7c\u7345\u6587\u5316\u4e8b\u696d\u516c\u53f8\uff0c1996\u3002\u00a0\u00a0", "recommended_readings": "\u8521\u5fd7\u7965\u300a\u6253\u91ae\uff1a\u9999\u6e2f\u7684\u7bc0\u65e5\u548c\u5730\u57df\u793e\u6703\u300b\uff0c\u9999\u6e2f\uff1a\u4e09\u806f\u66f8\u5e97\uff0c2000\u3002\u00a0\u5ed6\u8fea\u751f\u300a\u9999\u6e2f\u5929\u540e\u5d07\u62dc\u300b\uff0c\u9999\u6e2f\uff1a\u4e09\u806f\u66f8\u5e97\uff0c2000\u3002\u00a0\u912d\u632f\u6eff\u3001\u9673\u6625\u8072\u7de8\u300a\u6c11\u9593\u4fe1\u4ef0\u8207\u793e\u6703\u7a7a\u9593\u300b\uff0c\u798f\u5dde\u5e02\uff1a\u798f\u5efa\u4eba\u6c11\u51fa\u7248\u793e\uff0c2003\u3002\u00a0\u9ece\u5fd7\u6dfb\u4e3b\u7de8\u300a\u9053\u6559\u8207\u6c11\u9593\u5b97\u6559\u7814\u7a76\u8ad6\u96c6\u300b\uff0c\u9999\u6e2f\uff1a\u5b78\u5cf0\u6587\u5316\u4e8b\u696d\u516c\u53f8\uff0c1999\u3002\u00a0\u6b50\u5927\u5e74(Daniel L.

To understand the news can essentially help us know our society. Various concepts and theories from the mass communication discipline are introduced together with some perspectives from other social sciences. Real-life examples from Hong Kong and abroad are analyzed.Students are first introduced to the unique nature of news and different types of news as found in both print and electronic media. Some new news formats, including free dailies, online newspapers, network social media and citizen journalism, are discussed in both international and local contexts. Relationships between journalism and closely related professions such as advertising and public relations are explicated in order to understand the actual functioning of news, as well as its impact on society. The professional concerns of the field of journalism and individual\u2019s news consumption habits are also highlighted in the course.After taking this course, students will be able to understand more about news and its relationship with the society.

The first part sets the stage by examining the relationship between news and society, the nature and characteristics of news, as well as inviting students to reflect on their news reading habits. The second part deals with various major types of news, including social news, political news, entertainment news, and international news. The third part is about some emerging news trends in society, including the rapid rise of free newspapers, online newspapers and the new social network media as news channels. The final part discusses institutional relationships among news, advertising, public relations, and other social sectors. The reflection on journalistic professionalism and media ethics serve to round up and highlight the role and responsibilities of news in society.\u00a0The following is an outline of this course:\u00a0Week 1\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction: News and SocietyThe course starts by introducing the role of journalism as a vital social institution and its unique function as the often-quoted \"fourth estate\" of the government. But in fact news serves to monitor the government and the society, and thus freedom of the press is important not only to the journalists but to the general public. Contribution of newswork to the proper maintenance of the public sphere and establishment of a civil society is emphasized.\u00a0Key concepts: journalism as social institution, journalism as the fourth estate, press freedom, public sphere\u00a0Week 2\u00a0\u00a0 What is News: Characteristics and PerspectivesNews is a complex social phenomenon. It is so familiar to us but yet a simple and clear definition cannot be satisfactorily reached among academics and practitioners. Many agree that \"immediacy\", \"importance\" and \"interest\" are the three most important components. Others see news as some sort of deviant events. Some scholars regard news as vital social information while others think of it as a commercial product. Objectivity can be regarded as a noble ideal but some say it is a \"strategic ritual\". Scholars from the humanistic tradition would treat it primarily as a \"speech act\".\u00a0Key concepts: definitions of news, the three \u201cIs\u201d of news, news as deviance, objectivity as strategic ritual, news net, humanistic perspectives of news\u00a0Week 3\u00a0\u00a0 Cultivating Good News Reading HabitsNews consumption patterns were stable in the past but are now showing great changes due to the coming of the Internet age. People tend to read less print newspapers and spend more time getting information online. This is especially true for the younger generations who practically grow up together with the Internet. How can we instill the value of news reading to the young people? How can they become smarter readers, no matter which news venues/channels they tune to? New technologies are a threat to existing media but they also open up new opportunities and possibilities. It is essential for our students to be news literate in order to become an informed and critical citizen.\u00a0Key concepts: changing news use patterns, news consumer, critical citizenship, media education, technological impact\u00a0Week 4\u00a0\u00a0 Social News: Taste Strata of Mass and EliteNews about the society can vary according to the orientations of news organizations and the tastes of the reading/viewing public. The elite class has different taste preference over news when compared with the mass public. Fierce competition and marketization have driven many news organizations to go down the road of tabloidization and McDonaldization. They tend to hype the news and respond more to market \"wants\" instead of social \"needs\".\u00a0Key concepts: tabloidization, McDonaldization, market driven-journalism, hyping\u00a0Week 5\u00a0\u00a0 Political News: Monitoring Those in PowerNews is always intertwined with the government, politicians and those who have power in society. Various political forces want to control or influence the press in order to gain advantages. They feed and spin stories to the media, which on the other hand try to play the watchdog function and report news responsibly. News coverage in election settings will be examined to see how journalists and politicians interact with each other, and whether the public is properly informed.\u00a0Key concepts: spin doctoring, watchdog function, social responsibility theory, media and election, stereotyping\u00a0Week 6\u00a0\u00a0 Entertainment News: \"Interesting\", Not \"Public Interest\" Some people love entertainment news. They are keen on the \"interesting\" acts of or self-directed promotion by certain celebrities and have little concern over \"public interest\". As a result, entertainment news tends to be trivial or muckraking. The paparazzi teams sent by news organizations could not care less about invasion of privacy or damaging celebrities' reputations. The blurring of boundaries (between truth and falsehood, right and wrong, public and private, etc.) is something we should be aware of when reading this type of news.\u00a0Key concepts: trivialization, paparazzi, personal muckraking, blurring of boundaries, invasion of privacy\u00a0Week 7\u00a0\u00a0 International News: Our Window on the WorldThe course will talk about international news as the world is getting more and more global and integrated. It is essentially our window to look at the world outside. Between nations, diplomacy is often done through news reporting, which significantly reflects national interests. The major international news agencies play an important role. Journalists usually try hard to \"domesticate\" foreign news to make it more attractive to local audience.\u00a0Key concepts: media and national interest, public policy, media diplomacy, domestication of news\u00a0Week 8\u00a0\u00a0 Free Newspapers: The New Model That WorksTraditionally, TV is free but newspaper is paid. But in the past few decades, paid TV channels have quickly emerged as well as free newspapers. Print newspapers rely on both advertising and subscription or single copy sales. This business model is upset by the free newspapers which rely solely on advertising. People find that being free is irresistible, and they are less concerned about the quantity and quality of news as long as it is free of charge. What are the implications for the future of journalism? Would it popularize newspaper reading or downgrade the quality of journalism, or both? How do free dailies, paid dailies and online dailies interact? These are evolving issues worthy of closer examination.\u00a0Key concepts: distribution-driven journalism, free vs. paid, Metro Daily formula, work-habitation patterns, interactions among different types of newspapers\u00a0Week 9\u00a0\u00a0 Online Newspapers: News in the Internet AgeGoing online is a relatively new phenomenon for the press starting in the mid-1990s. It began as a low-cost spin-off that carried big promises both in terms of revenue and readership. The actual result favors the latter but not the former, and the journalism industry is still seeking a workable business model for online newspapers. But onlineDailies do revolutionize news delivery and its content because of its electronic and digital format. A new marketplace is forged but its potential has not been fully realized. Whether online newspapers would eventually replace the print versions remains an intriguing question for both the academics and the practitioners.\u00a0Key concepts: electronic marketplace, information marketplace, opinion marketplace, virtual media space, media format\u00a0Week 10 Social Network Media as News ChannelsIn the past decade, new social network media have become so popular that they also begin to act as news source and serve as a platform for news dissemination. What are their relationships with traditional news organizations? How do they affect the nature, delivery and quality of news? Scholars differentiate the role of traditional journalists as \"gatekeeping\" from the new role of online journalists as \"gatewatching\". Is citizen journalism in the Internet age a blessing or a curse? Would there be generational differences? All these questions will be explored in the course.\u00a0Key concepts: alternative media, Facebook, Twitter, blogging, citizen journalism, gatekeeping, gatewatching\u00a0Week 11\u00a0News and Advertising: Any Strings Attached with the Money?News and advertising seem to be inseparable worldwide. Journalists work together with advertising and marketing people to bring both news and product information to the readers/audiences. But the journalistic side and the market side of a news organization have different and even opposing ideals and goals. They are in constant battle but have to rely on the other for survival. How can news be immune from unwanted advertising influence? Why is public broadcasting possible but not public print journalism?\u00a0Key concepts: journalistic theory vs. market theory, theory of low involvement, types of advertising, commercialization, sponsorship \u00a0Week 12 News and Public Relations: How to Influence the PressJournalists and public relations people constitute another pair of actors in constant tension and cooperation. Journalists need news sources and public relations practitioners provide news and information to news organizations. But public relations people are often accused of staging pseudo-events in order to gain publicity and propaganda. They try to influence the press and get coverage. In recent years, many journalists leave the profession and join the public relations field as they know how news work and how to gain press coverage. It is an interesting topic and has major implications for the content and quality of news reporting.\u00a0Key concepts: pseudo-events, staging, manufacturing consent, propaganda model\u00a0Week 13 Rethinking News: Professionalism, Ethics, and AlternativesThis week is a wrap-up of the course by focusing on media professionalism and ethics. How can journalists do their job properly under all sorts of constraints? Can they adhere to a high standard of media ethics? Can news reflects different perspectives and interests in the society? Is the noble ideal of public journalism a viable alternative? How can news better serve our society and the general public? It is hoped that students will be able to reflect on these questions through the readings and the various assignments in this course.\u00a0Key concepts: journalistic professionalism, media ethics, multi-perspectival news, public journalism ", "required_readings": "Required readings:Week 1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction: News and SocietyWerner, W., & Nixon, K.

This course aims to examine a number of key issues that are closely related to developments in Internet and digital media. The advent of communication technologies has brought tremendous changes to media environments. Media convergence and participatory culture are two most notable emerging trends that have contributed to new forms of media production and consumption.

We will review and discuss how various factors have contributed to the invention and development of communication fads. \u00a0 Week 3 Mediated memories: How we remember and are remembered? Communication technologies have been important memory devices in human history. We will trace how communication technologies co-evolved with memory practices. \u00a0 Week 4 Social media: How we connect and are connected? What media are not \u201csocial media\u201d? Media always facilitate networking in different forms. We will reconsider what differentiates the social media we know of today from previous generations of social media. \u00a0 Week 5 Dating apps and romance  The meanings of \u2018romance\u2019 and \u2018intimacy\u2019 have undergone sweeping changes with the advent of dating apps in smartphones. In this class, we will examine the features of these apps and uncover their assumptions underlying \u2018love\u2019. \u00a0 Week 6 MOOC and learning  Massive Open Online Courses are introducing new forms of teaching, learning and academic accreditation. In a broader sense, how has Internet transformed learning? We will critically evaluate some popular claims in this aspect.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 7 KOL and public opinions Key Opinion Leaders are also known as social influencers or sometimes internet celebrities. They are seen to exert increasing influence in \u2018public opinions\u2019 or \u2018public sentiments\u2019.\u3000In this class, we will revisit earlier communication theory regarding two-step flow of information and see how Internet has brought new practices in shaping public opinions.\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 8 Streaming media and entertainment  In this class, we will focus on the case of streaming media and discuss how entertainment is changed in the Internet era. We will also consider how this in turn affects the production, distribution and consumption of media products. \u00a0 Week 9 - 10 Haters and comment culture Comment culture is a notable Internet phenomenon. Instead of looking at \u2018likes\u2019, we focus on the mechanisms behind \u2018dislikes\u2019 and the behaviors of \u2018haters\u2019.\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 11 Protest mobilization and social movements Internet is seen to be a key factor in protest mobilization. We will examine some key elements in social movements and discuss how social media, for example, have contributed (or not) in the mobilization process.\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 12 Surveillance and sensor society  The classic \u2018big brother\u2019 thesis is discussed with a careful consideration of many emerging practices in surveillance and self-surveillance. The idea of \u2018sensor society\u2019 will be introduced to see how we are (in)voluntarily contributing to a productive surveillance culture.\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 13 Hello future!  In this final class, we will reconsider the two central themes of convergence and participation and make both informed and wild guesses for the future. \u00a0 \u00a0", "required_readings": " Week 1 Phenomena, problems and issues \u00a0 Jenkins, H.

How the progressive ideas of sex and violence can enter the social realm of discussion through media representation will also be studied.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The course explores media representation as a powerful tool in perpetuating certain social reality in the following aspects: (1) it is additive to existing cultural values; (2) it supplements face-to-fact communication; and (3) the representation is monopolized (one-sided). The course also aims to sharpen students' sensitivity to the social reality that media representation of sex and violence as a commercial product is largely an outcome of the reliance of media organizations on advertising money as the funding source. In other words, the imperative of such media representation (a commercial product) is rooted in the particular socio-economic structures of commercial media organization.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The notion of \"power\" will also be studied in the following aspects: (1) it shapes our understanding of gender roles and \"just\" use of violence; (2) media organization is structurally more resourceful than the audience; (3) media representation of sex and violence is carefully constructed to appear as the \"normal\"/\"natural\"; and (4) the constructive nature of media representation is hidden.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Topics (subject to change by the instructor)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Introduction and getting to know each other\u00a0Media and Society\u00a0What's wrong with advertising?\u00a0Anything wrong with newspapers?\u00a0Aesthetics of violence and gender differences\u00a0Violence at a distance\u00a0Sex Industry I-Sex Workers\u00a0Sex Industry 11-Pornography and Erotica\u00a0Beauty is the beast?\u00a0Men from Mars, Women from Venus?\u00a0Gender and Intimate Relationships\u00a0Women are no longer the weaker sex?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "required_readings": "Course Pack Materials:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 1:\u00a0Read: \"Sex and Violence Don't Sell\"\u00a0Read: \"Yellow Journalism\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 2: Media and Society\u00a0Read: \"Mass Communication, Popular Taste and Organized Social Action\"\u00a0Read: \"True Crime: The Origins of Modem Sensationalism\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 3: What's wrong with advertising?\u00a0Read: \"Advertising: The magic system\"\u00a0Read: \"Handling Sex\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 4: Anything wrong with our newspapers?\u00a0Read: \"Modern Communication: Enlargement and Animation\"\u00a0Read: \"Social Production of News\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 5: Aesthetics of violence and gender differences\u00a0Read: \"Racism and the Aesthetic of Hyperreal Violence\"\u00a0Read: \"Aestheticization of violence\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 6: Violence at a distance\u00a0Read: \"Regarding the pain of others\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 9: Sex Industry I-Sex Workers\u00a0Read: \"Self-employment and 'Professionalism\"'\u00a0Read: \"Sex Worker\"\u00a0Read: \"Multiple Stigma, Discrimination and Violence\"\u00a0www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/TorontoPosters/instigmamsmfsw.pdf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 10: Sex Industry 11\u2500Pornography and Erotica\u00a0Read: \"Pornography and Male Supremacy7'\u00a0Read: \"Misguided, Dangerous and Wrong: An Analysis of Anti-pornography politics\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 11: Beauty is the beast?\u00a0Read: \"Beauty is the Beast\"\u00a0Read: \"Looking good: The psychology and Biology of Beauty\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 12: Men from Mars, Women from Venus?\u00a0Read: \"Masculinity\"\u00a0Read: \"Constructing Perfect Women\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 13: Gender and Intimate Relationships\u00a0Read: \"Preface to the Fourth Edition, 1891\u00a0Read: \"Intimacy Transformed?\"\u00a0Read: \"The mating game\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Week 14: Women are no longer the weaker sex?\u00a0Read: \"Sports, Media and Stereotypes\"\u00a0Read: www.batteredmen.com\u00a0Read: \"Battered Men?

With the advent of the new media technology, new forms of organizational crisis emerge. They are called Internet-mediated crises. A major difference between the Internet-mediated crises and the traditional crises lies in the intensive interactivity, collectivity, simultaneity and dialogic sphericity of the former. This very nature of Internet-mediated crisis makes it all the more hard to handle. A specialized and critical function of the public relations practice is the management of crisis. This course covers two major levels. The first level takes on a functionalism approach to crisis management. The second level takes on a more critical approach in public relations. Students will learn how crisis reflects complicity and dynamism between citizens and organizations in modern societies. They will acquire an enhanced appreciation of communication that can be brought to bear in such crisis situations and a greater familiarity with the interactivity of an organization and its stakeholders as well as the environments in times of crises.

Several crisis and non-crisis cases will be used for comparisons and discussions. At the end of the class, the students should be able to grasp the core characteristics of a crisis and the types of crisis commonly occurred in modern societies. Key concepts: Crisis vs. problem, types of crisis, crisis impacts \u00a0 Week 2 The stakeholder theory and the four models of public relations \u00a0 The class teaches Freeman (1984)\u2019s stakeholder theory. It proffers the students an overview of the scope of the stakeholder groups that an organization may need to handle in crisis communication and communication. It then introduces Grunig and Hunt\u2019s (1984) four models of public relations to give students a framework in viewing the relationships between organizations and stakeholders. Consequences of ignoring these relationships will be examined through the use of real crisis cases. Key concepts: The stakeholder theory, four models of public relations \u00a0 \u00a0 Week 3 The public, the media and the new media \u00a0 The class examines the evolution of the public demand and expectation on organizations in general and in times of crisis. The role of the media in shaping public opinion in crisis is also discussed. It also examines the impact of the advent of the new media technology on crisis communication and management. Online public forums on crisis cases will be studied. Key concepts: The critical mass, the media, the new media, the social media \u00a0 Week 4 Blog-related crisis in modern societies. \u00a0 Blog-related crises include crises initiated or facilitated by personal blogs. The class examines rumor and fact types of blog-related crises. To demonstrate, several recent examples are used illustrate the huge impact of public comments on blogs. Factors that contribute to effective blog-related crisis management are discussed. Key concepts: blogs, word-of-mouth and blogosphere \u00a0 \u00a0 Week 5\u00a0 and 6 Pre-crisis planning \u00a0 The class teaches a crucial stage in crisis management: Pre-crisis alert and planning. A good pre-crisis preparation may save an organization from a crisis. As such, students will be taught risk assessment, early detection and planning in the pre-crisis stage. Organizational structures and cultures that facilitate down-up reporting are necessary in early detection. Organizations that are particularly prone to crisis will be discussed. The importance of pre-crisis detection on the Internet and tools for monitoring will also be discussed. Key concepts: pre-crisis stage, crisis planning, risk assessment, organizational structures, organizational cultures \u00a0 Week 7 and 8 Crisis communication and management \u00a0 Benoit\u2019s (1995) image restoration theory and Coombs\u2019 (1999) on-going crisis theory will be used to build theoretical frameworks in conceptualizing crisis communication and management. The class also examines the principles in making news to give students some guidelines about what to say and do in times of crisis, especially upon media enquiry. Good and bad examples of crisis communication management will be used for comparison and contrast. Key concepts: crisis communication and management, image restoration theory, ongoing crisis, the making of news \u00a0 Week 9 and 10 Post-crisis communication \u00a0 Post-crisis communication is as important as crisis management because it determines how successful an organization is in restoring its image and reputation. It examines what is needed to be done for an organization to rebuild the lost trust. Several crisis cases will be used to investigate this topic. The students will explore on what constitutes a good post-crisis communication in this post-modern era. Key concepts: post-crisis communication \u00a0 Week 11 Guest speaker \u00a0 An expert in crisis communication and management will be invited to give a talk to students. \u00a0 Week 12 and 13 Corporate social responsibility, sustainability and crisis \u00a0 The concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) will be introduced. Cases showing the increased public demand on corporate social responsibility will be presented. The evolution of the concepts of CSR will also be discussed. The class will then examine the relationship between corporate social responsibility and pre-crisis, crisis and post-crisis management.

SUBLIMINAL PERSUASION \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Week 1: Subliminal Messaging and Materialism \u00a0 This week will introduce briefly all three sections and emphasis more specifically on subliminal persuasion, using materialism, luxury branding in China as examples. China has replaced Japan as the second strongest economic power in the world in 2012. It has also surpassed the US to become the second largest luxury brand market in 2009, spending of $9.4 billion and accounting for 27.5% of total global sales of luxury brands in the world. The invasion of luxury brands will inevitably alter the spending culture in China. Luxury brand ads hint subtly that consumers using them belong to a higher social group in the society. Students will discuss the subliminal indicators of luxury brand ads and their effects on attitudes towards social status in the society.\u00a0 \u00a0 Week 2: Commercialization of Friendship in Social Networking Sites \u00a0 Social networking sites are dominating the media landscape among young people. Many viral ads are circulated through the disguise of sincere recommendations from friends, who actually share information for an incentive. This class will look into the core of this issue: should friendship be commercialized for personal gains? \u00a0 Week 3: Properties, Personal Loan Ads and Wealth \u00a0 The recent waves of glamorized Hong Kong properties ads disseminated in China led to grave consequences in raising the prices of flats in Hong Kong. The property ads In Hong Kong shape unrealistic desires in viewers to own a flat that demands a lifetime of hard earned salaries. Personal loan ads encourage a supposedly free life of spending with no responsibility. This lesson will discuss the dynamics of these subliminal messages in affecting one\u2019s decision about how to spend his / her money. \u00a0 Week 4: Political Campaigns and Elections \u00a0 The presence of political campaigns in commercial media becomes prevalent these days due to the rise of democratization in the election process. This lesson will look into the various tactics and subliminal strategies used and manipulated in political advertising and its effects on public participation in election. \u00a0 II. MEDIATION OF REALITY \u00a0 Week 5: Beauty Ads and Body Image \u00a0 This lesson will start with an in-depth look at the concept of mediation of reality, using studies conducted in Hong Kong that relate beauty and slimming product / service ads to a negative self-perceived body image in both men and women. Teenagers, in particular, are finding their self in their growing years by comparing themselves to the models in the ads. The gap between the idealized self and actual self creates frustrations among many. To bridge the gap, some fall for crash diets and some for desperate acts of plastic surgeries. \u00a0 Week 6: Stereotypical Sex Ads and Gender Roles \u00a0 This lesson looks into the relationship between commoditization and objectification of the body and the resultant stereotypical roles played by men and women. Students will be challenged to live beyond the fixed roles narrowly defined and presented in the pseudo-reality. \u00a0 Week 7: Tutor King / Queen Ads and Education \u00a0 The educational system in Hong Kong requires students to acquire incessant training and upgrading. Many tutors chanced this opportunity to create fast track learning to success by advertising their success rate of getting a student to obtain an As. This form of promotion alters students\u2019 mentality to learning. Tutors acting as opinion leaders in ads create a trend of commercialized education. \u00a0 Week 8: A \u201cCopycat\u201d Culture \u00a0 \u201cCopycat\u201d China refers not only to the many cases of copying of products but also the imitation of ideas and other intellectual properties in China. Advertising is an industry that is keen on creativity, the very core element that sustains the industry. Piracy will suffocate the creative industry in the long run. Students will scan the creative landscape in China and learn to identify the seemingly original creative reality. \u00a0 III. INFUSION OF CONSTRUCTED MEANINGS \u00a0 Week 9: Freedom of Speech and the Press  This class will start examining the idea about meaning and value driven advertising/ advocacy. Recent cases show that advertising is affecting the press in Hong Kong and the Mainland has been censoring a lot of ads online and outdoor. What is the value of commercial speech? How much would the commercial speech be compromised? Will the censorship erode creativity, global branding strategy and business development? Students will investigate the longstanding struggle of the protection of speech in Hong Kong and the mainland. \u00a0 Week 10: Globalizing and Standardization \u00a0 Global brands launched by global advertising agencies bring about their unique culture from the country-of-origin into a foreign country. For a global brand to be successfully adopted by local citizens, the agencies need to accommodate the traditional culture. However, the global influence for standardization sometimes surpasses localization, resulting in a pervasive infusion of foreign values. The balance and consideration of both cultures are the center of discussion in this lesson. A few global campaigns around the world will be presented to demonstrate the delicate balance between globalization and localization. \u00a0 Week 11: \u201cAnti\u201d Campaigns and Social Movements \u00a0 This lesson will look into the value-driven impact and of Public Service Announcements (PSAs), including the anti-smoking, anti-drug and anti-AIDS campaigns on society. The lesson will also focus on the development, planning and execution of those campaigns. It is the purpose of the lesson to raise the awareness of the students in these cause advertising campaigns. \u00a0 Week 12: Earth Hour, Outdoor Light Pollution and other Green Campaigns \u00a0 Greenpeace and other environmental protection groups have been working on major campaigns to improve the living conditions of the world. A few successful green campaigns will be discussed in class to reveal their value shifting strategies. \u00a0 Week 13: Food, Drug Ads and Public Health \u00a0 World Health Organization has established the strong tie between advertising of high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) food and obesity. While UK has exercised blanket ban of food advertising to children and many other countries following suit, the Broadcasting Authority in Hong Kong has only advised five cases in the past four years regarding HFSS food ads to children. This lesson will investigate the difficult path to policy change in the business sector in Hong Kong. Advertising of all medicinal products in Hong Kong is strictly controlled by the Undesirable Medical Advertisements Ordinance (Cap 231) (the UMAO). Section 3 of the UMAO provides for an outright prohibition against the publication of 'any advertisement likely to lead to the use of any medicine \u2026 for the purpose of treating \u2026 or preventing' any disease, disorder or abnormal physical state. However, some prominent direct-to-consumer prescription drug ads are produced and broadcasted in Hong Kong recently. DTC drug advertising will change the traditional beliefs towards doctor-patient relationship and the demand of name-brand drugs at the expense of generic or equally effective drugs. Students will explore the Campaigns of Gardasil and Cervarix to find out their use of Government bodies as fa\u00e7ade to lure the public to consult doctors about the drugs.", "required_readings": " Tentative Reading List \u00a0 I.

Sports are often thought of as trivial, or as unimportant games to amuse young people. But in the wealthiest countries, sports represent huge portions of GDP and are important topics of daily conversation. Almost half the world watched the 2010 football/soccer World Cup. Sports have been compared to religions in their ability to unite people and to inspire fanatical devotion.The academic study of sports is interdisciplinary, with contributions from psychologists, historians, gender studies scholars, sociologists and anthropologists. This course will take an interdisciplinary approach while emphasizing anthropology\u2019s focus on culture, on the experience of participants, and on both symbolic and political-economy aspects of sports. Topics will include Race and Performance, Sports and Rituals, Sports as Moral Education, Gender and Sexuality in Sport, Sports and Nationalism, Globalization of Sport, the Olympics, and Sports Stars and the Media.

This course addresses the ways in which social media and other related interactions in cyberspace have become a central element in the everyday lives of humans across the globe in the 21st Century. Our modern lives are now largely interwoven with digital technologies that have not only changed our own cultures, but also have brought forth new cultural forms through mobile phone technologies, networked \u201csmart\u201d-products, and cultural groupings only possible through digital means. The course approaches the anthropology of these digital cultures through its main themes\u2014the transformation and expansion of social media, social research online, the intermixing of our online and offline lives, critical social issues of online lives, and the question of posthumanism. These themes are addressed explicitly in the course, and are also the subtexts of the different lectures, readings, and project work. Students will learn the techniques of online fieldwork and referencing. They will explore a diverse array of new ethnographies on social media: on gender, political movements, online dating, hacking, and gaming culture. These ethnographies also serve to model online social research and provide examples of methodology and design. The social consequences of cyberspace are addressed in the topics of internet pornography, addiction, surveillance, activism, and social networking. Gender and identity issues are a continuous theme throughout the course, highlighting how online lives accentuate already existing dynamics. Hong Kong connections to these subjects will also be critically discussed, often drawing on topical themes presented on blogs and forums. Students will learn of the philosophical questions of posthumanism and the nature of technologically mediated human culture. This serves as a philosophical ballast to the course allowing students to reflect personally on their own experiences and how technology has and will continue to shape their lives. The role of anthropology in understanding and capturing human culture in this context anchors on the investigation of how technology is possibly making us \u2018more\u2019 human than previous forms of cultural life. \r", "outcome": "\u00a0 \u00a0 After taking this course students will have learnt how to design and perform online fieldwork and manage digital referencing.\u00a0 \u00a0 Students will know of and understand the recent history and development of the internet and key platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, eBay, iTunes, and the ways in which cyberspace has become embedded in the everyday work and social lives of over 2.4 billion internet users.\u00a0 \u00a0 Students will be able to explain and discuss the various debates on the social consequences of online technologies with regard to the tensions between online lives and (so called) real lives, or digital dualism.\u00a0 \u00a0 Students will be able to address and articulate issues of political and philosophical change, activism, addiction, surveillance, the body and visual culture in connection to mobile technologies.\u00a0 \u00a0 Students will know of some philosophical discussions on the nature of humanity in this new epoch. The question of humanity, posthuman futures, and transhumanism is a key concern that runs throughout the course. Students will also come to consider social media and our changing digital cultures as deeply significant to new understandings of gender and body identity.\u00a0", "syllabus": " \u00a0Core Content\u00a0  Online Field Work \u2013 Exploring how researchers have performed social research online. This will equip students with a knowledge of the approaches, techniques and challenges of field work in cyberspace. Whilst being a core topic, this is also part of the weekly project work of the course. Students will start \u00a0\u00a0their digital research from the beginning of the course, by first developing a blog and networking with classmates.  Cultural History of Cyberspace \u2013 How did the world go online? This topic addresses the historical and technological developments that led the world to go online. Its key concern is to highlight how this has altered and affected society, and how quickly online life has become a part of everyday life.  Social Networking Sites \u2013 The rise of web 2.0 and how the internet has become social. How have different SNS emerged, how do they connect, isolate, liberate, and limit social activity? Online Culture is explored via the different uses of various SNS platforms, and their own identities.  Sex and Body Culture in Cyberspace \u2013 Tackles the social consequences of online pornography in different social and cultural circumstances. Body politics, risk, and sexuality online.  Posthumanism \u2013 This is framed in the first week as a key issue and returns as the focus of the last 2 weeks of the course.This topic looks at the impact of cyberspace on our philosophical understanding of our bodies and ourselves. How is technology changing our attitudes to gender, ethnicity, religion, and is it making us more or less human?  Online Activism \u2013 Explores the relationship between cyberspace and participatory politics, social justice, terror, and extremist groups Proposed weekly topics with core content highlighted.\u00a0 Week 1:- Introduction: Starting Digital Research (Going Viral) Week 2:- Cultural History of Cyberspace Week 3:- Social Networking Sites Week 4:- Sex and Body Culture in Cyberspace Week 5:- Video Gaming Culture \u2013 Play & Recreation Week 6 :- Internet Addiction Week 7:- Online Activism Week 8:- Cyber-Surveillance and Crime Week 9:- Online Field Work Week 10:- Free Software, Inclusion, and Sharing Week 11:- Virtual, Real, and Hybrid Space Week 12:- The Selfie, the Self and Posthumanism Week 13:- Future Scenarios of Cyberspace Thematics: Online Research is covered as part of project work throughout the course. Weekly work on blogs relate to class discussions and require students to source and reference. It is addressed as a key topic in Week 1 & Week 9. Social Consequences of online lives as a theme is most strongly represented in the topics of week 5, 6, 8, 10 and 11. As well, because of the salience of this topic it \u00a0relates to other core topics such as 3,4,7, 11, and 12. Posthumanism is a philosophical theme that is introduced in Week 1 and is relevant throughout the course. It is tackled directly as a concluding theme in the final two weeks of the course (12 and 13). \u00a0 \u00a0", "required_readings": " \u00a0\u00a0 Week 1 - Introduction: Starting Digital Research (Going Viral) Miller, Daniel and Heather Horst, \u201cThe Digital and the Human: A Prospectus for Digital Anthropology\u201d, in Digital Anthropology, ed.

The first part \u201cDepth Psychology and Its Cultural Formulations\u201d begins with the Freudian psychoanalysis and its discovery of the unconscious, which has almost become the hallmark of the modern mind. This is followed by a discussion on the encounter of psychoanalysis with 19th-century anthropology that has resulted in imaginative meditations on culture and civilization.\u00a0\u00a0 Week 2.

It is an interesting site where complex global processes can be traced. Flows of capital, film personnel, technologies, ideas and creativity are vibrantly circulating inside and outside the cultural industry of filmmaking, resulting in phenomena such as transnational co-productions and cross-cultural cooperations. These dynamic processes are inflected in characterization, plot development, and space-time configurations on Hong Kong screens. This course takes students on an interdisciplinary exploration of the local-global interactions from a variety of approaches. With a selection of Hong Kong films, the course aims to help students attain a thorough understanding of the two-way relationship between the local, popular entertainment and the global film scene by investigating the major questions concerning globalization.

It explores a range of broad issues including: population and urbanization, materials resources, and human systems (such as transportation and public health), in order to understand the concept of \u2018sustainable development\u2019. It evaluates the different media and strategies that people have used / are using to advocate for more sustainable approaches to the environment and community.This course is run using a \u2018flipped classroom\u2019 pedagogy. Students are required to undertake up to one hour of pre-class activities (typically watching and responding to on-line course videos) in preparation for the classroom sessions which are run in workshop format involving a wide range of group activities and interactive exercises. There are no tutorials in this course. The on-line components deliver the bulk of the course content, in class activities are designed to develop understanding of the content, to explore contexts and interconnections, and to actively apply it to different scenarios.\r", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "2819", "title": "Grand Challenges for Global Citizens in the 21st Century", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "DiscussionField Studies/Field-tripLecture", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Office of University GE", "requirements": "Co-requisite: Any course with \u201cUGFH\u201d or \u201cUGFN\u201d as prefix", "description": "The 21st century is an era of global connectedness with urgent, complex and intricate problems which can only be tackled by coordinated and concerted efforts of all people of the world.

Students will learn to identify global issues, analyse the complexity and interdependence of these challenges, and assess critically the role SDGs play in addressing global challenges. They will also reflect on their responsibilities of being global citizens, and discuss with their peers to formulate possible solutions to make the world a better place.

What are the key differences humans and other animals? Is it ethical to raise and slaughter animals for food, conduct tests on, and buying or keeping animals as pets? How ought one to respond to unethical laws on animals? What are the social impacts of these actions? Students will develop an interdisciplinary perspective in the fields of animal studies, ethical theory, sociology and environmental philosophy by understanding how ancient and contemporary philosophers, sociologist, environmental scientists, ecologists, activists, and journalists have responded to key ethical questions concerning animal rights and its social implication. Topics to be discussed include: animal-machines, ethical meat eating, radical vegetarianism, and the evolution of pets.\r", "outcome": " Upon completion of the course, students will be able to:  cite the major arguments in the current philosophical debates over the social and moral status of nonhuman animals, and understand the strengths and weakness of each;  recount the historical, scientific and cultural contexts of the debate;  discuss the broad range of animal exploitation and the moral issues that each form of it raises;  form a conclusion about the ethics of using animals and defend it with a strong, logical argument.", "syllabus": "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Introduction: Animal in Our Society\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.1\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What is \u201cAnimals\u201d? the Differences between Human and Non-human\u00a0\u00a0 1.2\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Role of Animal Domestication in Human Society: A Historical Overview\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 3\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Current Situation of Animals in Our Society\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Image of Animals in Our Society\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.1\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Western Tradition: Mythology, Literature and Social status\u00a0\u00a0 2.2\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Chinese Tradition: Mythology, Literature and Social status\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Moral Status of Animals\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Animal Welfare Vs Animal Rights\u00a0\u00a0 3.2\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Utilitarian Approach\u00a0\u00a0 3.3\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Right-based Approach\u00a0\u00a0 3.4\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Capabilities Approach\u00a0\u00a0 3.5\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ecofeminist, Contractarian and Virtue Ethics Approaches\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Animals as Food : Meat industry\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A History of Meat Eating\u00a0 \u00a0 2\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Modern Intensive Farm : A Case Study\u00a0 \u00a0 3\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 To Eat or Not to Eat\u00a0 \u00a0 4\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Vegetarianism as Social Movements\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Animals as Tools: Medical and Entertainment Industry\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Animal Experiment\u00a0 \u00a0 2\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zoos and Entertainment\u00a0 \u00a0 3\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Animal as Working Tools\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Animals as Pet and Commodity: The social phenomenon \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Is it Wrong to Buy and Sell Animals?\u00a0 \u00a0 2\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Commodification of Pet Species\u00a0 \u00a0 3\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ethics of Keeping Pets\u00a0 \u00a0 4\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Pet-o-philia\u00a0 \u00a0 5\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Death of pets\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conclusion: \u00a0\u00a0 7.1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Peaceful Co-existence: The Relation of Human and Animals\u00a0\u00a0 7.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Animals as Family Members, Companion and Social Members\u00a0\u00a0 7.3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Road to Citizenship in Our Society\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0", "required_readings": " Week 1-2: \u00a0 \u201cHistory\u2019s Biggest Fraud\u201d in Yuval Noah Harari.

The issue is further complicated by the recent debate on the social responsibilities and economic sustainability of the URA. On the economic side, affected property owners and tenants are concerned about compensation while there are effects on the revitalized economy of the area particularly in major comprehensive redevelopment projects. Redevelopment in old urban areas is also important for developers and the development industry, given the scarcity of urban developable land. On the heritage side, both the hardware of historic buildings and the software of traditional businesses, arts and culture could be affected but regeneration might also be a positive intervention.

It is a significant development strategy proposed by the Chinese Government spanning approximately 60 countries in Asia, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, with a total population of 4.4 billion. This initiative takes advantage of global transportation routes, core cities, and key ports to build international economic co-operation corridors. The effective operation and management of the BRI require collaboration among a broad range of disciplines comprising civil engineering, material science, government operations, economics and finance, social and political science, and environmental science. A critical and multi-disciplinary understanding of the BRI can provide insights into basic requirements, geopolitical impact, physical barriers, and sustainability potential of the infrastructural projects it proposes to undertake and help relevant stakeholders address large-scale and complex challenges in the lifecycle management of those infrastructure projects.

Specifically, it is concerned with living out feminist consciousness in every step of making fundamental and lasting social change. With this in mind, Living Feminisms is not an exposition of feminist theories per se but an exploration of how social change effort would look like when we take up feminist consciousness that transcends separateness and duality. It explores the root causes that lead to the domination system that has plagued humanity for centuries, examines the possibility of having a fundamental and lasting social transformation that supports life of all, and takes a closer look at a few selected alternative practices such as restorative justice and sharing economies that hold out hope in times of crises. The course also equips students with practical knowledge of being a change agent, introducing some practices with feminist consciousness that transform limiting beliefs about social change, nourish resilience by taking care of social and political trauma, and cultivate need-based facilitation skills and leadership that help navigate conflicts in the process of making internal as well as external transformation. To put it in a nutshell, Living Feminisms is a course that cultivates change agents with feminist consciousness.Living Feminisms deeply resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as a blueprint for building a sustainable future by 2030. The course directly touches on alternative practices working towards the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). ", "outcome": " Upon completion of the course, students will acquire both knowledge and skills of social change that are in line with feminist consciousness. Specifically, they will be able to explain the roots of the domination system and a series of factors contributing to its perpetuation, and able to make change by transforming internal and external resistance. Students will be empowered to take lead in change effort through collaboration with others and mastery of conflict transformation skills.\u00a0Students will learn to appreciate making a sustainable future requires transformation in areas broader than the conventionally defined economic realm.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "syllabus": " Class 1: How We Got Where We Are and Where Are We Heading? \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Riane Eisler and Douglas P.

Inaction Explained \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How can we explain inaction of people witnessing immense suffering of others? Is the notion of false consciousness adequate?

What is important is the kinds of action we undertake What is nonviolence? How does it work? What are its limits? \u00a0 Class 6: Social Trauma and Social Transformation \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trauma is an overwhelming experience that outweighs the containing capacity of our nervous system How does trauma relate to and shape our political behaviors? Rather individualizing trauma as a single person experiences, how can we theorize collective trauma? \u00a0 Class 7: Practice: Self-Care & Inner Resources \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Change agents are prone to feel despair, powerlessness and hopelessness because they are more acutely aware of the enormity of suffering How to nourish our heart to make it open to pain and suffering while keeping the passion alive? \u00a0 Class 8: Reconciliation and Justice: Exploring Transitional Justice \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Common collective responses to atrocities are either forgetting or vengeance. Is transitional justice a viable third way? How does it work? What are the experiences of the 40 Truth and Reconciliation Commissions that have ever set up in human history can tell us? \u00a0 Class 9: Sexual Violence: Exploring Restorative Justice \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our current justice system is a kind of retribution that punishes those who violate the law. How does it look like if we shift from retribution to restoration that focuses on needs and rebuilding of broken relationships? How controversial is it when applying to sexual violence? \u00a0 Class 10: Collaboration and Feminist Leadership: Coming to Terms with Power \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Activism often entails working with others. Is power necessarily evil? How does feminist leadership look like? How can we consciously use power in a way that does not subjugate but empower others? How can we replace power-over with power-with, power-to and power-within? Power-cube analysis \u00a0 Class 11: Alternative Organizing - Holacracy, Sociocracy and Deep Democracy \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are always implicit agreements as to how to make decisions, define the nature and the scope of a task, evaluate outcome, and handle conflicts if we do not consciously decide how and what to decide  \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Quite a many grassroots organizations have been experimenting with new ways of organizing that is more efficient than representative democracy in meeting the needs of all. These alternative forms of governance include Holacracy, Sociocracy and Deep Democracy. \u00a0 Class 12: Practice: Workshop on Convergent Facilitation \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Convergent facilitation, developed by the feminist Miki Kashtan, a form of facilitation that caters for both willingness and efficiency in order to come up an agreement, decision and/or concrete strategies that maximally work for the needs of all within a group. The workshop will cover the whole process from the start to the end convergent facilitation is a proven one as it was applied to a group who disagreed with each other about legalization of abortion \u00a0 Class 13: Beyond Neoliberalism? Sharing Economy \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our current economies are profit-driven that more often than not serves a few but exploits most of other people Is it really hopeless to revise capitalism? Is Sharing Economy a viable alternative? \u00a0 Class 14: Conflict Transformation: From the Personal to the International Disagreements and conflicts among activists are commonplace. However, acquiring ways of resolving and transforming conflicts within groups is a skill that is urgently needed but seldom given enough attention this last lecture will touch on conflict resolution and mediation. \u00a0", "required_readings": " CLASS 1 How We Got Where We Are and Where Are We Heading? \u00a0 Required Readings: \u00a0 l Eisler, Riane and Douglas P.

This course examines the gender dimensions of innovation and novelty. The key questions are: How/Why/What/When innovation(s) are gendered? We will discuss the fluidity and messiness of doing and undoing gender in innovation practices and meanings produced. Broadly defined, innovation refers to new ideas, new knowledge, new technologies, new designs, and creative practices with the goal to solve social or technical problems. Many innovations may seem gender-neutral but are inherently imbued with gender perceptions. The course will equip students with ways to apply gender analysis to decipher innovations and innovative processes. The course incorporates sustainable development goals (SDGs) on Gender Equality and Reduced Inequalities to become more discerning toward more sustainable practices to advance Industry Innovation and Infrastructure. Using case studies from the technology culture, the routine practices, and the emergent new economy, students will learn to untangle how gender intersects with the seemingly neutral artefacts of innovation and technology. The course further covers how emergent issues of diversity and inclusion, AI and information technology, social entrepreneurship and social innovation, and leadership style could reshape the existing relationship between gender and innovation to advance sustainability and social resilience.", "outcome": " By the end of the course, committed students will have attained: \u00a0 \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A deeper understanding of how innovations and technologies are gendered \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A sense of the distinctive and shared views in reflecting how gender shapes innovation and entrepreneurship \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Knowledge and ability to apply gender analysis to identify and describe different processes of innovation and entrepreneurship \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reflexive Insights into the power dynamics played by individuals and institutions in the creation of novelty \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ability to synthesize different theoretical traditions and disciplines that study gender and innovation \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Capability to evaluate technology and science-based entrepreneurial projects on their inherent gender assumptions and provide relevant suggestions \u00a0 \u00a0", "syllabus": " Week 1: Introduction: When are Innovation(s) Gendered? \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Innovations in science and technology often seemed gender-neutral, when do they become gendered?  \u00b7\u00a0 To innovate for a more sustainable future, having SDG goals in mind are important in any innovative ventures, and the course begins with the SDG goals on gender equality and reduced inequality to identify gaps in science and technology. \u00a0 Week2: Doing and Undoing Gender in Innovation \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We will discuss the ways that gender analysis contributes to our understanding of innovation. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Embedding gender analysis in science research could help filter out inherent biases to further advance the innovative processes. \u00a0 Week 3: Why/How is Innovation Gendered? \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While debates about the gender dimensions of technology are many, has feminism changed science?

Topics will include the key semiotic and psychoanalytic approaches of the 1970s-1990s, classic films which have inspired feminist debate, avant-garde cinema, local cinema, independent cinema, and postmodern cinema, as well as recent cinematic re-conceptualizations and exploration of gender and sexuality local and abroad. In systems of representation from fine art to mainstream cinema to advertising, women have been constructed and existed as spectacle or passive object \u201cto-be-looked-at,\u201d in Laura Mulvey\u2019s now often quoted words. Following her trail, feminist critics turned their attention to mainstream films and popular media addressed to female spectators and exposed the contradictions within and between the notion of \u201cwomen\u2019s pictures\u201d and the diversity of female experience. Local cinemas and independent creators also tell their own unique stories of women\u2019s lives in dramatically different cultural contexts. Critics from other fields further complicate these images by examining them through lens including race, class, ability, queerness, and more.Mulvey\u2019s groundbreaking analysis of gendered looking relations in classical Hollywood cinema has since generated numerous analyses of the place of women as spectacle or passive object in films \u201ccut to the measure of [male] desire.\u201d Critics around the world showed how different groups of women attempt to take control of their positioning through viewing or using texts in their own ways, and by creating their own. What happens when female-identified artists, audiences, and theorists look back, and seek to rebel against such cinematic traditions by experimenting with alternative visual languages and narrative tools? This course starts with the paradigm of narrative film analysis that Mulvey outlined in the 1970s and move on to explore a wider range of questions in feminist film studies, including spectatorship, authorship, popular culture, character stereotypes in genre films, self-representation, (g)local cinema, and new feminist media. Students would be introduced to trailblazing works by female filmmakers worldwide, special focus will be placed onto important works in Hong Kong cinema for critical examination and comparative studies. Through critical reflections on notions such as gender stereotypes, representation, power, diversity, and equality, the course engages directly with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by engaging directly with the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities).", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "3224", "title": "Family and Society", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "LectureInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Office of University GE", "requirements": "UGEC3224 is double-coded with GDRS3009. ;Not for Gender Studies Majors; and students who have taken GDRS3009 or SOCI2218(3222). ;Co-requisite: Any course with \u201cUGFH\u201d or \u201cUGFN\u201d as prefix", "description": "(UGEC3224 is double-coded with GDRS3009.) \r This course examines issues revolving the family as a social institution in different cultures. It explores processes of how the family is constructed in different forms as it intersects with various social systems including kinship, marriage, class, ethnicity, religion, and political economy. Particular attention is paid to how family as a gendered construction, while being a basic principle of social life globally, exhibits great diversity as it shapes and is shaped by local histories, traditions, and state policies. In an era of globalization and transnational mobility, the ideology and practice of the family are rapidly changing, but there are simultaneously trends of reversion and localization. Students will read ethnographies and develop cross-cultural perspectives on classic and contemporary issues concerning the family, such as work and domesticity, motherhoods and fatherhoods, sexual orientations, reproductive technologies, surrogacy and adoption. Students learn to critically think and articulate about family issues, and will acquire enhanced knowledge and skills in reflexive thinking and positive communication, cultural sensitivity, and diversity and inclusion. The course is relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, in particular SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).", "outcome": " Upon completion of the course, students will be able to:  describe anthropologically the different forms of family and the reasons they exist in different cultures, and have a broad-base understanding and worldview of the diversity of human experiences.  engage in contemporary debates in relation to the definition of family, same-sex parenthood and reproductive technologies, and to develop skills to dissipate stereotypes and discriminatory practices regarding sexual orientations.  analyze issues surrounding domesticity and violence against women in different cultural settings, and investigate potential solutions for gender inequality and evaluate barriers to related problems in their own society.  reflect on and apply concepts of cultural relativism, and to analyze ethnocentrism and explore ways to terminate racial discrimination.  reflect on their ability and steps to take as change-makers and agents of justice and peace.", "syllabus": "  1. The Family: An anthropological perspective (SDG #5, 10, 16)  The family is often imagined to be a social institution with a set of values and relationships shared by everyone in society. This is far from reality. In this lecture we look at the definitions of family across cultures, and look at how family interacts with different social systems such as religion, political system and modes of production, and investigate how family values may differ in different ethnic groups and how they change over time. Concepts of cultural relativism and holism will be introduced.\u00a0  \u00a0  2. Kinship and lineage\u00a0(SDG #5, 10)  Kinship and lineage have played an important part in the political economy of society, in the past as well as in present time. In this lecture we discuss the commonalities as well as the differences across cultures, and look at the factors leading to continuity and/or change, such as urbanization, globalization, appearance of reproductive technologies, adoption, surrogacy, and changing values in sexuality.  \u00a0  3. Role of marriage in family\u00a0(SDG #5, 10, 16)  This lecture looks at how marriage may or may not be related to family formation, and the role of marriage in society. In addition, marriage regulations and practices are highly related to gender ideologies. These relations exist in diverse forms and have transformed over time, for example as governments promulgate new marriage laws and as civil society demands for reform.  \u00a0  4. Domesticity and gender division of labor\u00a0(SDG #5, 10, 16)  How was the idea \u201cman are breadwinners; women are homemakers\u201d formulated in history and how is it challenged in contemporary society? This lecture will discuss issues of domesticity and how gender division of labor at home is related to the gender division of labor in society. We will examine the roles of religion and science, as well as of the church and\u00a0 government in the production of gendered social arrangements. Students will learn to identify systemic barriers to gender equality.\u00a0  \u00a0  5. Violence against Women\u00a0(SDG #5, 16)  Why are women the majority of victims of domestic violence across cultures? Why do many women choose to stay in abusive relations? In this lecture we look at the social and cultural factors that influence women\u2019s decision to confront, escape, or endure domestic violence, and discuss how family and \u00a0ideologies and practices have played a part in the perpetuation of VAW in different cultures. Students will investigate potential solutions for VAW as a form of gender inequality.  \u00a0  6. Parenthood and socialization\u00a0(SDG #5, 10)  Do all parents love their children? Do parents in different cultures raise their children the same way? Why is raising children in families with same-sex parents, single parents, and migrant parents considered problematic? If socialization is the way to reproduce socially acceptable individuals, what form, content, and means should it take? This lecture seeks to dispel the misconception that parent-child relations are natural and uniform, by looking at the diverse forms of parenthood and ways of socialization in different cultures.  \u00a0  7. Spousal relations: duties, affection, and intimacy\u00a0(SDG #5, 10)  How is spousal relationship culturally constructed? What are the components of spouse-hood and how do they relate to politics, economics, religion and other social systems? Why do extra-marital affairs happen and how does society deal with it? This lecture looks at the ideology and practice of spouse-hood across different cultures, and asks what role it has in formulating the family as social institution. \u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0  8. Globalization, affluence and livelihood\u00a0(SDG #5, 10, 16)  This lecture looks at global transformation processes and how they affect the family both as a social institution and as a network of related individuals. We look at how consumerism, social media, and converging values seemingly sync-ing familial structures and emotions across the globe, but at the same time noting how families in different societies, as they undergo globalization and wealth polarization, are torn by desires of economic growth and downward social mobility.\u00a0  \u00a0  9. Transnational mobility and family\u00a0(SDG #5, 10)  In an era of globalization, more and more people cross national borders for a better life, creating transnational families as family members live in different countries in the form of split households, or as individuals become members of family in a different culture. In this lecture we look at this growing phenomenon and discuss issues about acculturation, family relations and power dynamics, how affines and agnates create transnational communities, and what happens to those who are left behind in the hometown.  \u00a0  10. New kinship and alternative family\u00a0(SDG #5, 10)  We will discuss how arrangements such as same-sex marriage, cohabitation, and polygamous relations would challenge conventional understandings of kinship and family in society. We will reflect on these issues in relation to contemporary debates on heterosexual normativity, monogamy, and same-sex relations.  \u00a0  11. Doing family in China\u00a0(SDG #5, 16)  The concept of family has various levels of meanings in Chinese culture, and throughout Chinese history these have transformed in response to the needs and ideologies of the time. While Han families may share certain idealized views of the family as a social system, its practice is perhaps as varied as the number of families. Ethnic groups and Chinese overseas communities add to this complexity as their worldviews, religions, and socioeconomic environments acculturate thinking and behavior that differ from what is understood as Chinese core values.  \u00a0  12. Doing family in Asia\u00a0(SDG #5, 16)  This lecture will bring together ethnographic cases in Asia to illustrate the interaction of different social systems revolving around the family. By comparing changes and continuities of family formation and relations in the region using a cross-cultural perspective, we are able to reflect on our own culture, and understand the pros and cons of the ideologies and practices that we are socialized in.\u00a0  \u00a0  13. Family, power, and intersectionality\u00a0(SDG #5, 10, 16)  This lecture discusses individuals\u2019 multi-layered identities and how these intersect with family membership. We will examine roles, statuses and power generated from positions in the family, gender and ethnicity, at work and school, on the media and more. The multiple locales in which individuals perform their everyday experiences are examined holistically, which helps us rethink how seemingly \u201cnatural\u201d behavior are really cultural constructs, and how taken-for-granted ideas of family membership shape our everyday lives, our life goals as individuals, and the regulations and resources that constitute society.  \u00a0 \u00a0", "required_readings": " 1.

Is personal interest a better explanation of gender imbalances in occupations? What are the ways that biases exist in education and the workplace, and how do teachers, parents, and employers contribute to gender biases (SDG goal 5)? Can gender equality in performance and hiring be improved by removing stereotypes? The literature will cover childhood, adolescence as well as adulthood in order to provide insight into the age-related changes of the gender issues.

economically underprivileged, minorities with disabilities, sexual/erotic minorities, gender minorities and youth in light of the latest scholarly discussions on multiculturalism, pluralism and the

This course examines men\u2019s diverse experiences as boys/men and public discourses and practices about masculinities. It will focus on how the gendered social order influences men\u2019s actions and the way men perceive themselves, other men, women, and social situations. It will pay special attention to the exploration of the relationships between multiple dimensions of social relations and inequalities including gender, race/ethnicity, class, and sexual orientation.

How do we understand and connect to animal kingdom?How do human-animal connections shape modern culture and society?How do cultural studies and humanities expand our scope on animal and nature?Culture is ordinary, in Raymond William\u2019s saying, but the ordinariness is merely treated as a reflection of human everyday life. Although cultural studies has sustained concern on everyday life with mass production, consumerism, sexism, racism and postmodernism, the discipline always lags behind the concern of nature and animal species. As the issues of animal abuse, environmental protection, factory farming, animal protection policy and law-making, as well as media various portrayals being the hot topics of our (post)modern world, the study of animal with the perspective of cultural studies and other humanity disciplines can explore the possibilities of better human-animal relationship. This course is designed with an empathic concern of other-than-human animals. By exploring different issues of human and animals\u2019 life, this course looks for a harmonious balance of nature and modern culture.This course focuses on three areas, through which we can explore the different aspects of animal and cultural studies. These areas are:A. Entering Jurassic Park \u2013 Remaking Animals in Leisure (Lecture A1-A4)B. Attacking Godzilla \u2013 Representing Animals in Media (Lecture B1-B4)C. Finding Nemo \u2013 Revitalizing Animals in the City  (Lecture C1-C4)Each area covers a set of animal issue discussion. Area A, apart from theorizing animal with cultural studies, tackles the basic animal issues: pet-nurturing, zoo-building, forest-sustaining and tourism. This is to provide a foundation for understanding animals with a critical reflection of everyday life. Area B, set with the concern of media, discusses issues of animal representation in cartoon, cinema, literature and journalism. This is to read how animals would be represented and how this affects human understanding and related policy-making. A screening will be run after Lecture Area B. This is to provide an alternative understanding of animal representation in popular media. Area C further deals with the matters of animal-city relationship in seeing how dogs and cats, cattle and swine, and fishes and dolphins are (mal)treated in the street, the farm and the sea respectively. This is to end the course with a leading thought of perfect balance of nature and modernity; and more queries of human-animal relationship will be raised for contemplation.", "outcome": " Learning Outcomes: On successful completion of the course, students are expected to be able to:  Explain the concern of other-than-human animal with cultural studies perspective;  Identify the key issues and critical assessment of human-animal relationship;  Understand the approach in studying culture, animal and environment;  Enrich the angle of analyzing human living and animal species.", "syllabus": " Area A\u00a0 Entering Jurassic Park \u2013 Remaking Animals in Leisure Week 1.

It also examines how various international norms have found their way to shaping the tiny colony, which has stood in stark contrast with Mainland China, to whom Hong Kong's sovereignty was returned in 1997.\r", "outcome": " Upon successful completion of this course, the student will 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 be able to identify a broad range of issues towards of the impact of British colonialism to Hong Kong 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 be able to recognize and describe the history of Hong Kong\u2019s external relations in the modern era reflecting the features of early Globalization and the international norms, including free-trade policies, popular nationalism, rise of anti-colonialism, Transnational Corporations and democratization 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 be able to analyze and elaborate the features of early Globalization and the international norms from historical, political, economic and socio-cultural dimensions 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 be able to reflect independently and critically on the position and role of Hong Kong under the British colonial rule and post 1997 with sovereignty returned to China", "syllabus": " Major concepts and topics to be covered:  \u00a0 PART I: CORE CONCEPTS AND BACKGROUND Empire and Colonialism: Why and How were they formed?

Key concepts will be introduced to help students make sense of cultural patterns as articulated in movies and television programs. Key concepts: textuality, contextuality, media representations(2) The Birth of Hong Kong ManThe lecture will focus on the cultural differentiations of mainlanders and Hongkongers in the 1970s. Students will think about the question of why Hong Kong people, mostly ethnic Chinese, saw themselves as a rather different social group of their own. A few classic texts will be used to illustrate the logic of \"othering\" and stigmatizing mainlanders.Key concepts: \"other\", cultural imaginations, stigma(3) New Wave Film and Colonial PoliticsThe lecture will introduce some basic concepts of colonialism.
