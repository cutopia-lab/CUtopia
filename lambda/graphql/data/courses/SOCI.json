Since the 1950s, the city experienced an economic miracle, withstood numerous financial crises, and is in the process of economic restructuring. Politically, it has turned from \u201cthe last Colony\u201d of Great Britain into a Special Administrative Region of the PRC. Culturally, the flourishing Canto pop-culture coincides with the emergence of a local identity. Using a sociological perspective, this course critically reflects on the impact of these profound changes on the construction of the so-called \u2018Hong Kong identity\u2019. Who is a HongKongese? This seemingly simple question underlies critical issues and boundaries about nationality, ethnicity, language, culture, class, and citizenship. The construction of a Hong Kong identity necessitates the drawing of boundaries that include and exclude, defines who is entitled to resources and power and who is not, and projects differential expectations of rights and responsibilities on insiders and outsiders. The question thus has profound impacts on how resources and power are distributed in society, and affects the life chances of individuals, families and society.(Advisory: Not for Sociology Majors.)\r", "outcome": "        \u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u671f\u671b\u9054\u5230\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4e94\u500b\u5b78\u7fd2\u6210\u679c:  \u00a0 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u5e0c\u671b\u900f\u904e\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b, \u4ee5\u793e\u6703\u5b78\u7684\u8996\u91ce\u53bb\u5e6b\u52a9\u540c\u5b78\u5c0d\u9999\u6e2f\u6230\u5f8c\u7d93\u6b77\u904e\u7684\u7d93\u6fdf\u767c\u5c55, \u653f\u6cbb\u8b8a\u5316, \u53ca\u6587\u5316\u4e0a\u7684\u885d\u64ca\u6709\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u53ca\u6279\u5224\u6027\u7684\u4e86\u89e3;  2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u4f7f\u540c\u5b78\u80fd\u5920\u5168\u9762\u601d\u8003\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u5efa\u69cb\u5982\u4f55\u53d7\u793e\u6703, \u7d93\u6fdf\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u74b0\u5883\u5f71\u97ff, \u4e26\u660e\u767d\u8eab\u4efd\u5efa\u69cb\u80cc\u6240\u6d89\u7684\u6b0a\u5229\u8207\u7fa9\u52d9, \u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u8207\u7d93\u6fdf\u8cc7\u6e90\u5206\u914d.  \u00a0 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u4ee5\u4e00\u500b\u793e\u6703\u8b8a\u9077 (social change) \u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u53bb\u8a0e\u8ad6\u8eab\u4efd. \u4f7f\u540c\u5b78\u660e\u767d\u9999\u6e2f\u4eba\u9019\u4e00\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u5efa\u69cb\u8207\u9999\u6e2f\u904e\u53bb\u534a\u4e16\u7d00\u7684\u793e\u6703\u6539\u8b8a, \u5305\u62ec\u672c\u571f\u5316, \u53bb\u5de5\u696d\u5316, \u7d93\u6fdf\u8f49\u578b, \u5168\u7403\u5316, \u65b0\u4e2d\u7522\u968e\u7d1a\u7684\u8208\u8d77, \u4e3b\u6b0a\u79fb\u4ea4\u7b49\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2.  \u00a0 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u4ee5\u4e00\u500b\u8f03\u5b8f\u89c0\u5168\u9762\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u53bb\u4e86\u89e3 \u2018\u9999\u6e2f\u4eba\u2019 \u9019\u500b\u8eab\u4efd\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u53d7\u793e\u6703\u7d50\u69cb (social structure) \u8207\u500b\u4eba\u7684\u4e92\u52d5\u7684\u5f71\u97ff; \u4e26\u555f\u767c\u5b78\u751f\u601d\u8003\u2018\u500b\u4eba\u8eab\u4efd\u2019 (individual identity)\u8207\u7fa4\u9ad4 (groups), \u793e\u5340(communities), \u793e\u6703\u7cfb\u7d71, (systems), \u548c\u5236\u5ea6 (institutions) \u7684\u95dc\u4fc2.\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u900f\u904e\u591a\u6a23\u5316\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u65b9\u5f0f, \u5305\u62ec\u5609\u8cd3\u8b1b\u8005,\u591a\u5a92\u9ad4\u5f71\u97f3\u6559\u6750\u64ad\u653e\u53ca\u8a0e\u8ad6, \u548c\u5c0f\u7d44\u5c08\u984c\u7fd2\u4f5c \u4f7f\u540c\u5b78\u5c0d\u9999\u6e2f\u793e\u6703\u7684\u6b77\u53f2, \u7d50\u69cb, \u6587\u5316\u548c\u5728\u9019\u500b\u793e\u6703\u88e1\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u793e\u7fa4\u6709\u4e00\u500b\u8f03\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u4e86\u89e3, \u4ea6\u80fd\u5b78\u7fd2\u5230\u4ee5\u8f03\u5168\u9762\u5b8f\u89c0\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u53bb\u601d\u8003\u554f\u984c.

Urbanization \u2014 the increase of the share of the population living in cities \u2014 was one of the developments that early sociologists sought to study and explain. Since then, the global urban population has only continued to increase. Today, over half of humanity lives in cities and towns. Understanding urban society is no less essential than it was in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Urban sociology has many sides, but in this course students will learn about four main topics: 1) the distinctive social character of the \u201curban experience,\u201d 2) the economic role of cities within society, 3) the dynamics of investment in urban land and the construction of the \u201cbuilt environment\u201d in cities, and 4) major social problems facing urban areas today including poverty, affordability, safety, and the effects of climate change.

What is it like to live in a city? How do people interact with each other in cities? How is it different from life and social interactions in rural areas or smaller towns? The size and density of cities turn out to make for distinctive ways of living and interacting.\u00a0\u00a0Part II: Industrial and Post-Industrial Cities\u00a0\u00a0This three-week section will consider the changing economic significance of cities in modern society. Why do particular industries cluster together in cities or neighbourhoods? How is globalization and financialization changing cities? What are the challenges faced by cities in the Global South today?\u00a0\u00a0Part III: Use and Exchange of Urban Space\u00a0\u00a0In these three weeks, the readings and lectures will consider different sociological accounts of the spatial development of urban areas. What are the consequences of the fact that cities are both spaces where people live and work and investment markets for profit-seeking developers? This will touch on phenomena including gentrification and property bubbles.\u00a0\u00a0Part IV: Urban Problems; Whose Solutions?The final four weeks will look at some challenges confronting cities today. How is increasing inquality impacting urban life? How can crises surrounding housing\u00a0availabiliy, control of public space, and climate change be dealt with? Cities are as much sites of struggle as they are of industry and commerce.

Is inequality an inevitable feature of human life? (b) How many social classes are there? What are the principal? \"fault lines\" or social cleavages that define the class structure? Are these cleavages strengthening or weakening with the transition to advanced industrialism? (c) How frequently do individuals cross occupational or class boundaries? Are educational degrees, social contacts, and \"individual luck\" important forces in matching individuals to jobs and class positions? What other social and institutional forces affect occupational attainment and allocation? (d) How are the lifestyles, attitudes, and personalities of individuals shaped by their class locations? Are there identifiable \"class cultures\" in past and present societies? (e) What types of social processes and state policies serve to maintain or alter racial, ethnic, and sex discrimination in labor markets? Have these forms of discrimination weakened or strengthened with the transition to advanced industrialism? (f) Will stratification systems take on new and distinctive forms in the future?

A main theme of these readings and lectures is that social relations of power and domination have many more facets and dimensions than are apparent to the naive eye.Part III: Troubling TrendsThe third part of the course confronts the question of how contemporary society should be understood. The readings of these weeks offer descriptions and explanations of the driving dynamics of the recent past.

By the end of the semester, you will be equipped with the skills to conduct solid research as well as critically examine and evaluate the findings and assertions of others. Most importantly, this course is an opportunity to be exposed to useful tools to help you study and think about the things that interest you, and improve your ability to tell a story about what you learned in a convincing and nuanced manner.
