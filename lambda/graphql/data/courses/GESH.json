Through a careful sequenced selection of outdoor team activities, workshops, service and work projects, students are challenged to examine their orientation in life as they become college members in university. Success of the course hinges on balancing two axes of concern, namely, (1) between teamwork and personal development and (2) between inward reflection and outward expression.This course is the major common learning experience of college students across all disciplines and years, initiating a fresher's identity as a member of S.H. Ho College. The activity-based approach facilitates the cohort of freshers to bond together as well as to integrate with the college community.
