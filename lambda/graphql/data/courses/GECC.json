Students will form an interdisciplinary team to conduct a small group research on topics of interdisciplinary nature, current affairs, cross-disciplinary knowledge or daily life issues. With preliminary work and most of the research being carried out in the second term and the summer of the preceding academic year, students are enrolled to the course in term one, normally in the 4th year of study (Y4T1), where students will deliver an oral presentation, exchanging ideas with one another in a seminar context and submit written works.This course cultivates knowledge and skills in problem solving, critical thinking and value judgment; nurtures appropriate attitude and techniques in cross-disciplinary collaboration, rational and contributive teamwork as well as analysis with multiple perspectives.Advisory: 1. This course is intended for senior year students: a. Course registration at Term 1 of the graduation year (e.g. Y4T1),  pre-registration in Term 2 of preceding year (e.g. Y3T2). b. Students admitted to Senior-Year Places who will complete their undergraduate programme in 2 years should make pre-registration in Y1T2 for course registration in Y2T1. c. Students enrolled in an undergraduate programmes of more than 4 years of study (BChiMed, BEd, BNurs, MBChB), should normally follow the same schedule in 1(a) of taking this course in their 4th year, instead of their final year (5th or 6th year).2. Students must pre-register with the College in Term 2 of preceding year (e.g. Y3T2) and conduct most of the research work required in the summer.3. Students should refer to \u201cpossible schedule\u201d at below section \u201cSyllabus\u201d for preparing wisely your study plan across the preceding term, the preceding summer and the course registration term (e.g. Y3T2, Summer & Y4T1).4.
