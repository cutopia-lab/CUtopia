Students from different programmes are highly recommended.\u00a0 Students in one group should discuss with their supervisors and compromise a topic for the group research project. This project\u00a0should not be just a purely academic research study but a project related to various impact of life sciences on the society of Hong Kong with or without some laboratory-based research components. The students in a group are required to investigate the proposed topic with teamwork and team building elements. The students should first survey the background of their research project and identify the scientific questions they want to address. The students then design and perform the laboratory-based experiments and/or non-laboratory-based research for this project under the guidance of the supervisors and submit a research proposal in the term end.Potential projects should include components as follows,1. Knowledge-oriented trainingStudents should attend laboratory training, workshop or tutorials, in which the core knowledge of relevant scientific knowledge of life sciences, including laboratory-based experimental design, scientific paper reading and writing, and basic calculation and statistics in life sciences, etc. are given.2. Technical skill-orientated trainingStudents should arrange their practical training, including laboratory-based research skills, information technology and data search, computer software for data analysis, etc. for their projects.3. Experience and exposure enhancementStudents should participate in various learning activities such as 1) laboratory-based research; 2) surveys; 3) site visits; 4) field studies, etc. and learn to appreciate the applications of Life Sciences for social enterprises.4. Teamwork and team buildingStudents should learn the importance of good collaboration among the people working in a group to achieve a shared goal. The team members should share the vision to complete the project effectively and efficiently before a deadline. Also, students working in a team should learn to trust and respect each other and every member should have its own duties and responsibilities.\u5728\u5b78\u671f\u958b\u59cb\u6642\uff0c\u5b78\u751f\u61c9\u4e3b\u52d5\u8207\u4e09\u81f3\u56db\u500b\u5b78\u751f\u7d44\u6210\u5c0f\u7d44\u3002\u5c0f\u7d44\u5efa\u8b70\u7531\u4f86\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u7684\u5b78\u751f\u7d44\u6210\u3002\u540c\u7d44\u5b78\u751f\u61c9\u8a72\u8207\u4ed6\u5011\u7684 \u5c0e\u5e2b\u8a0e\u8ad6\uff0c\u4e26\u70ba\u5c0f\u7d44\u7814\u7a76\u9805\u76ee\u78ba\u5b9a\u4e00\u500b\u4e3b\u984c\u3002\u9019\u500b\u9805\u76ee\u4e0d\u61c9\u53ea\u662f\u7d14\u7cb9\u7684\u5b78\u8853\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u800c\u61c9\u8207\u751f\u547d\u79d1\u5b78\u5c0d\u9999\u6e2f\u793e\u6703\u7684\u5404\u7a2e \u5f71\u97ff\u6709\u95dc\uff0c\u7576\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e36\u6709\u6216\u4e0d\u5e36\u6709\u5be6\u9a57\u5ba4\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6210\u5206\u3002\u5c0f\u7d44\u4e2d\u7684\u5b78\u751f\u9700\u8981\u901a\u904e\u5718\u968a\u5408\u4f5c\u548c\u5e36\u6709\u5718\u968a\u5efa\u8a2d\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u4f86\u7814\u7a76 \u63d0\u8b70\u7684\u4e3b\u984c\u3002\u5b78\u751f\u61c9\u9996\u5148\u8abf\u67e5\u7814\u7a76\u9805\u76ee\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e26\u78ba\u5b9a\u4ed6\u5011\u8981\u89e3\u6c7a\u7684\u79d1\u5b78\u554f\u984c\u3002\u7136\u5f8c\uff0c\u5b78\u751f\u5728\u5c0e\u5e2b\u7684\u6307\u5c0e\u4e0b\u8a2d\u8a08\u548c\u57f7\u884c \u6b64\u9805\u76ee\u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u5ba4\u5be6\u9a57\u548c/\u6216\u975e\u5be6\u9a57\u5ba4\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u5b78\u671f\u672b\u63d0\u4ea4\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u8b70\u66f8\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u9805\u76ee\u61c9\u5305\u62ec\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5167\u5bb9\uff1a1. \u4ee5\u77e5\u8b58\u4e3b\u5c0e\u7684\u57f9\u8a13\u5b78\u751f\u61c9\u53c3\u52a0\u5be6\u9a57\u5ba4\u57f9\u8a13\uff0c\u8b1b\u7fd2\u73ed\u6216\u500b\u5225\u6307\u5c0e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u61c9\u63d0\u4f9b\u8207\u751f\u547d\u79d1\u5b78\u76f8\u95dc\u7684\u79d1\u5b78\u77e5\u8b58\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u77e5\u8b58\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u65bc\u5be6\u9a57\u5ba4\u7684 \u7684\u5be6\u9a57\u8a2d\u8a08\uff0c\u79d1\u5b78\u8ad6\u6587\u7684\u95b1\u8b80\u548c\u5beb\u4f5c\u4ee5\u53ca\u751f\u547d\u79d1\u5b78\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8a08\u7b97\u548c\u7d71\u8a08\u7b49\u30022.\u4ee5\u6280\u8853\u6280\u80fd\u70ba\u5c0e\u5411\u7684\u57f9\u8a13\u5b78\u751f\u61c9\u5b89\u6392\u5be6\u8e10\u57f9\u8a13\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u65bc\u5be6\u9a57\u5ba4\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u8853\u548c\u6578\u64da\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u7528\u65bc\u6578\u64da\u5206\u6790\u7684\u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u8edf\u4ef6\u7b49\u30023.\u589e\u52a0\u7d93\u9a57\u548c\u63a5\u89f8\u5b78\u751f\u61c9\u53c3\u52a0\u5404\u7a2e\u5b78\u7fd2\u6d3b\u52d5\uff0c\u4f8b\u59821\uff09\u5be6\u9a57\u5ba4\u7814\u7a76 ; 2\uff09\u8abf\u67e5 ; 3\uff09\u5be6\u5730\u8003\u5bdf ; 4\uff09\u5be6\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u7b49\uff0c\u4e26\u5b78\u7fd2\u6b23\u8cde\u751f\u547d\u79d1\u5b78\u5728\u793e \u6703\u4f01\u696d\u4e2d\u7684\u61c9\u7528\u30024.\u5718\u968a\u5408\u4f5c\u548c\u5718\u968a\u5efa\u8a2d\u5b78\u751f\u61c9\u8a72\u5b78\u7fd2\u5728\u5718\u968a\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u5011\u4e4b\u9593\u9032\u884c\u826f\u597d\u5354\u4f5c\u4ee5\u5be6\u73fe\u5171\u540c\u76ee\u6a19\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u5718\u968a\u6210\u54e1\u61c9\u8a72\u5206\u4eab\u9858\u666f\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u622a\u6b62\u65e5\u671f \u4e4b\u524d\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5b8c\u6210\u9805\u76ee\u3002\u540c\u6a23\uff0c\u5718\u968a\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u5b78\u751f\u61c9\u8a72\u5b78\u6703\u4e92\u76f8\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u4e92\u76f8\u5c0a\u91cd\uff0c\u6bcf\u500b\u6210\u54e1\u90fd\u61c9\u8a72\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8077\u8cac\u548c\u8cac\u4efb\u3002", "required_readings": "Relevant reference materials will be provided by the supervisor.", "recommended_readings": "", "terms": {"2020-21 Summer Session": {"-J01-PRJ (1465)": {"startTimes": ["TBA"], "endTimes": ["TBA"], "days": ["TBA"], "locations": ["No Room Required"], "instructors": ["Professor NGO Chi Ki Jacky"], "meetingDates": ["18/05/2021 - 29/06/2021"]}}}, "assessments": {"Others": "40", "Project": "40", "Participation": "20"}}, {"code": "4912", "title": "Group Research in Life Sciences (II)", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "2.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Project", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "School of Life Sciences", "requirements": "Not to be taken with BCHE4902, BIOL4902, CMBI4902, ENSC4902, FNSC4902, MBTE4902 and LSCI4000 at the same term.", "description": "This course is a capstone course consists of group research projects to investigate the heated topics related to Life Sciences, such that students will be inspired by how different fields of life sciences have made their impacts on the globalized knowledge-based society of Hong Kong.

This course is specially designed for advanced level of undergraduates, not only because of the course content, but it requires the students to think and integrate knowledge learnt from different courses in biology, molecular biology, cell biology, biotechnology, genetics, ecology, etc. In addition, a problem will be initiated by students and to be solved via searching for knowledge and information from diverse channels not only limited to scientific journal articles. Furthermore, a voluntary/optional field trip is organized for the students to define the problem of their own interests. These will help students to understand and analyse the problems from various aspects and multiple angles.
