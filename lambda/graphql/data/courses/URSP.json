Increasingly uneven and intensified processes of urbanization simultaneously generate serious challenges and exciting opportunities for urban populations across the globe.

This course revolves around the distinctive rhythms, experiences, and dynamics of urban life. What gives urban living its distinct characteristics? What current social, economic, and political problems deserve the attention of urban inhabitants? Which issues generate the greatest discord and motivate full coordination among different actors involved in governing cities? As urban life is characterized by both cosmopolitan conviviality and immense inequality, in this course students will learn about different modes of coexistence and exclusion in contemporary cities. Globalizing forms of urban protest arising from struggles over urban resources, space, and decision-making mechanisms will be investigated.

Urban regeneration offers some unique opportunities for the re-planning of some developed space for a better environment, where architectural conservation, landscape improvement, and better urban design can be implemented. However, owing to the many stakeholders, economic reasons and the diversified concerns, the process is also creating major debates in the community.Besides the deliberation on the theoretical concepts, the course will go through the technical process of urban regeneration which includes land use planning, architectural conservation, landscape and environmental improvement and urban design. This will enable students to understand the mechanism of urban transformation process thoroughly and may inspire them to further their studies in specific professional fields.On the social side, redevelopment as a major tool of urban regeneration often disturbs and uproots existing residents, small local businesses and their social networks. Together with the issue of compensation this has been causing major public concerns.
