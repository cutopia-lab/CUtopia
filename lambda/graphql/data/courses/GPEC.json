Electricity illuminates and operates the world. Modern transportation systems are energy intensive. However, energy is also the major source of air pollution and greenhouse gases. The competition for energy resources have fueled international conflicts and even wars. Rich endowments of energy resources could be an economic blessing but mismanagement may turn the advantage into an economic curse. Energy markets shape global economic and political systems, while various concerns such as security, safety, reliability, affordability and environmental impacts also dynamically drive their evolution. The global monetary system that is dominated by U.S. dollars has a core in the petrodollar system. Unconventional oil and gas resources are reshaping global geopolitical maps. Nuclear energy emits little CO2 but has experienced several catastrophic accidents. The rise of renewable energy could overthrow the dominance of fossil fuels since the industrial revolution. This course aims to guide students through a wide and interconnected array of real-world topics as suggested above. The covered energy markets include fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas), non-fossil conventional fuels (nuclear and hydro), renewables (wind, solar and biomass), as well as electricity. Students should have an open mind and be creative. Active participation in class discussion is highly encouraged. Never hesitate to interrupt the instructor in the classroom. The instructor welcomes questions and appreciates challenges. The hope is that students will have fun in taking the course and get more interested in the topics after one semester.

The economic transformation over the last four decades has been remarkable and significant. The most notable one is the successful transformation of a centralized and a planned economy into a market (non-market) one. Moreover, China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2002 to engage fully with the globalization trend. With these internal and external backdrops, contemporary Chinese society has been undergoing many changes, facing challenges and having abundant opportunities too. In this course, several contemporary salient issues will be focused such as higher education, inequality, migration, aging, corruption and health, among others. Their causes, problems, consequences and implications will be examined within the framework of state-society relationship.Last, but not least, discussions will be encouraged in the class. The dialogue should provide an excellent forum for students to engage in an active mode of learning. Ideas can be tested; points will be made, and, above all, judgements will be formed. This will further cultivate a sense of intellectual dialogue within a productive and an encouraging environment.", "outcome": "1.

While the quasi-superpower\u2019s goals are focused on attaining a bigger say in reshaping the international financial architecture, its voice is being heard on issues ranging from Free Trade Agreements and commodity prices to climate change and food security. Under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, Beijing is packing a bigger punch in institutions and forums including the International Monetary Fund as well as the G20 and APEC. Moreover, the Xi administration is trying to buttress China\u2019s global influence through overarching undertakings such as the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d or the Belt and Road Initiative (B&RI) to nurture cross-border and inter-continental infrastructure projects. The Belt and Road grand plan will also showcase China\u2019s aggressive Outbound Foreign Direct Investment (OFDI) strategy as well as the country\u2019s leaps-and-bounds advancement in high technology. In the course of the teaching and discussion, ample weight will be given to the roles of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, which are substantial players within the \u201cGreater China\u201d universe. Apart from analyzing world-sized projects and activities involving the Belt and Road, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the G20 as well as UN institutions, this course will examine China\u2019s relations with major countries and regions, particularly the U.S., Russia, Japan, the two Koreas, India, the ASEAN and EU from the global political-economy perspective. A common theme will be to appraise the extent to which Beijing can sell its \u201cwin-win\u201d scenarios in trade, investment and security-related cooperation to global partners. The Xi administration, however, has to counter the \u201canti-China containment policy\u201d supposedly being spearheaded by countries including the U.S., India, Japan, Vietnam and Australia. Beijing must also reassure developed countries that it is not stealing their technologies through M&A operations \u2013 and developing nations that it is not pursuing neo-colonialist agendas. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) administration\u2019s ability to win over countries and regions and to enlarge its global footprint depends, however, on the viability of the \u201cChina model.\u201d Whether China can modernize government institutions and corporate governance \u2013 and raise the competitiveness of its industrial and services sectors \u2013 is pivotal to its objective of becoming a norm-setter in the global political economy. These important issues will be analyzed and discussed in class after students have gained a good understanding of the Chinese economic structure, the country\u2019s foreign-policy and national-security priorities, and latest developments in the global political economy. ", "outcome": "The main objective of this course is to equip students with an adequate grasp of China\u2019s goals and decision-making processes in relations to Beijing\u2019s enhanced global power projection, particularly its growing role in the international political economy. A key understanding of China\u2019s objectives and strategies ranging from reshaping the world\u2019s financial order to boosting investments in intercontinental infrastructure projects will enable students to gain fresh perspectives on China\u2019s fast-changing economic and political ties with international institutions as well as major countries and regions.\r\u00a0\u00a0After taking this course, students should be able to fully understand \u2013 and be able to form their own views on: \r\u00a0\u2022 The goals of Chinese foreign and national-security policies; and ways in which Beijing seeks to play a bigger role in reshaping the international financial order; \u00a0\u2022 China\u2019s strategies of enhancing its leadership capacity in global institutions and forums; \u00a0\u2022 Beijing\u2019s ambitious projection of financial power through massive overseas investment as well as boosting inter-continental infrastructure projects; \u00a0\u2022 The pros and cons of major policy agendas such as the Belt and Road Initiative \u2013 as well as formidable challenges that they face;\u00a0\u2022 Chinese concerns and game plans regarding the formation of free trade zones and handling global issues such as climate change, commodity prices and food security; \u00a0\u2022 The pillars of the \u201cChina model\u201d and the quasi-superpower\u2019s drive to promote innovation in government systems as well as the industrial and services sectors.\r\u00a0\u00a0Students should be capable of not only making informed analysis but also formulating their own theories and hypotheses regarding the full range of topics. For example, students should use IR and global political economy theories to assess the degree of success of China\u2019s financial and trade-related \u201cgreat leap outward.\u201d Such prognosis and prognostication should be based on references to latest journal and news publications, ideas introduced by the lecturer, as well as debates within classes among advocates of different viewpoints. Guest lecturers who are practitioners in the finance, think-tank, and diplomatic sectors might be invited to give talks to students.", "syllabus": "Topic 1. CHINA\u2019S CONCERNS AND STRATEGIES IN MAJOR ARENAS OF THE GLOBAL POLITICAL ECONOMY\r\u00a0The lecture and class discussion will focus on how China the fast-rising quasi-superpower is boosting its clout in the global political economy through major initiatives in diplomacy, national security, and international economics and finance. \r\u00a0The Xi Jinping administration's new priorities on different aspects of state security -- including financial, energy and environmental security -- will be examined. Particular attention will be paid to China\u2019s diplomatic and economic relations with powers and blocs including the United States, the EU, Japan, Russia, ASEAN, and world bodies such as the UN, the IMF, and the G20.\r\u00a0\u00a0Topic 2. CHINA\u2019S ECONOMICS-BASED DIPLOMACY AND OUTBOUND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (OFDI); THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE \u201cBELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE\u201d \r\u00a0Beijing has since the 2000s sought to use its economic heft and influence as diplomatic tools to improve its relations with \"peripheral states\" and great powers alike. \r\u00a0The Xi Jinping administration\u2019s employment of economic inducements such as overseas development aid and outbound foreign direct investment (OFDI) will be studied. Discussion will be held over the execution of China's economics-based diplomacy in selected theatres such as ASEAN, Africa as well as the U.S. and the EU. Assessment will be made of the efficacy of the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d game plan.\r\u00a0Students are encouraged to make suggestions as to how Beijing can better utilize OFDI and related strategies to win friends and neutralize enemies. Emphasis will be put on agendas including securing reliable supplies of energy and other resources; procuring high technology; and marketing Chinese products and know-how including high-speed railways.\r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Topic 3. FOCUS ON THE CHALLENGES OF THE \u201cBELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE\u201d\r\u00a0An assessment of the significance of the Belt and Road Initiative in view of comparative global undertakings such as the Marshall Plan in post-WWII Europe. Questions will be asked about whether Beijing is shouldering most of the investment burden given lackluster response from the U.S. and the EU. Thorough appraisals will be made of the long-term viability of multi-billion-dollar projects in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, which bear the hallmark of overseas development aid (ODA). Also discussed will be foreign economists\u2019 views that Beijing\u2019s commitments to big projects in Asia and Africa will exacerbate China\u2019s already serious debt problems. Comparisons will be made between the B&RI and the Asia African Growth Corridor sponsored by Japan and India.\r\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Topic 4. CHINA, THE G20 AND BEIJING\u2019S EFFORTS TO RESHAPE THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE \r\u00a0Beijing has since the global financial crisis of 2008 sought to play a more assertive role in reshaping the international financial architecture. The Xi administration's strategies and performance in global forums such as the G20 will be assessed. Students will be asked to discuss major Chinese goals ranging from promoting the global status of the renminbi to ensuring fair trade particularly with the developed world. Also analyzed will be Beijing efforts together with other BRICS members to ensure that major developing countries will have a bigger say in reforming the global financial infrastructure. The long-term significance of the Asian Infrastructure Development Bank \u2013 and its perceived challenges to the Asian Development Bank and the IMF \u2013 will be appraised. \r\u00a0\u00a0Topic 5. GLOBAL INTERACTIONS: FTAs, FOOD SECURITY, COMMODITY PRICING AND CLIMATE CHANGE\r\u00a0The lecture and discussion will focus on China the assertive international actor in areas including the formation of free trade agreements and trade pacts with countries ranging from ASEAN members to Central Asian states. Also analyzed will be China\u2019s efforts in engaging in global solutions relating to urgent tasks such as boosting food supplies, reducing carbon emissions, and promoting green energy solutions. Comparisons will be made between the Beijing-initiated Regional Comprehensive Economic Pact (RCEP) and the half-defunct Transpacific Partnership (TPP) spearheaded by the Obama administration. Emphasis will be put on how Beijing can prove itself as a responsible stakeholder if not a leader in the solution of global problems and the provision of global public goods. The fact that the Trump administration has displayed an anti-globalization stance \u2013 and Washington\u2019s pulling out of the Paris Accord \u2013 has afforded the Xi administration new opportunities of demonstrating China\u2019s commitment to globalization and to becoming a rule-setter in international intercourse.\r\u00a0\u00a0Topic 6. THE GLOBAL POLITICAL ECONOMY PERSPECTIVE OF CHINA-U.S. RELATIONS\r\u00a0After examining the voluminous literature (in both English and Chinese) on Sino-U.S. relations since WWII, this class will discuss new challenges on the trade and foreign-policy fronts in the Xi Jinping and Donald Trump administrations. The traditionally win-win, symbiotic economic ties between the two giants could be jeopardized by security challenges epitomized by the North Korea crisis. One example is whether Trump could use trade-related threats to force Beijing to use more forceful means to restrain Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program. Also analyzed will be the role of Taiwan in complicating Sino-U.S. relations from the global political-economy perspective.\r\u00a0\u00a0Topic 7. THE GLOBAL POLITICAL ECONOMY PERSPECTIVE OF CHINA-RUSSIAN RELATIONS\r\u00a0The lecture and class discussion will focus on the global political economy factors behind the quasi-alliance relationship between China and Russia. For geopolitical and security reasons, both leaderships have developed a strong bondage based on their mutual concern about countering the American threat. Relevant IR theories will be explored to discuss the common China-Russian front on the North Korean issue. Manifestations of China-Russia cooperation in the form of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization will be assessed. However, these two former Cold War \r\u00a0adversaries also harbor deep-seated distrusts over issues such as China\u2019s economic predominance: Central Asia, hitherto Russia\u2019s backyard, has become a Chinese economic sphere of interest particularly in the wake of the R&BI. \r\u00a0\u00a0Topic 8. THE GLOBAL POLITICAL ECONOMY PERSPECTIVE OF CHINA\u2019S RELATIONS WITH THE TWO KOREAS AND WITH JAPAN\r\u00a0The North Korean missile and nuclear crisis has thrown into sharp perspective the convoluted quadrangular relations between China, the two Koreas, and Japan. What are the historical \u2013 and geopolitical \u2013 reasons behind Beijing\u2019s refusal to jettison or at least curtail its alliance relationship with the DPRK? Questions of history as well as disputes over several pieces of rocks (called the Diaoyus or Senkakus) have put obstacles in the way of a symbiotic economic relationship between China and Japan. Discussion will be informed by latest research on the rich but complicated traditions of China-Korean and China-Japanese ties. \r\u00a0\u00a0Topic 9. THE GLOBAL POLITICAL ECONOMY PERSPECTIVE OF CHINA-INDIAN RELATIONS\r\u00a0Despite exceptionally fast growth in bilateral trade in the past decade, Beijing and New Delhi are locked in dispute over border rows \u2013 as well as suspicions of each other\u2019s \u201ccontainment policies.\u201d China and India, however, are important members of the BRICS group, as well as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. China-India ties thus offer plentiful illustration of the interaction of potential economic symbiosis juxtaposed against increasingly ferocious geopolitical contest. \r\u00a0\u00a0Topic 10. THE GLOBAL POLITICAL ECONOMY PERSPECTIVE OF CHINA-ASEAN RELATIONS\r\u00a0China scored a major victory on the global political economy front when the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague ruled against her claims on the South China Sea in 2016 \u2013 and nothing seemed to happen. Most ASEAN states are beholden to China due to massive trade and investment benefits emanating from their \u201cwin-win scenarios\u201d with China. That Beijing can still hang on to its claims relating to the \u201cnine dash lines\u201d demonstrates the limits of international law in restricting the behaviors of a rising quasi-superpower.\r\u00a0\u00a0Topic 11. THE GLOBAL POLITICAL ECONOMY PERSPECTIVE OF CHINA-EU RELATIONS\r\u00a0Although French President Emmanuel Macron has warned against Chinese firms acquiring high-tech EU manufacturers, Beijing\u2019s buying power \u2013 and geopolitical clout \u2013 is such that it is picking up not only tech companies but also ports and mines in Europe. Beijing is also accused of \u201cdivide and rule\u201d tactics through its special relationship with the 16 central and east European members of the EU (the so-called \u201c16+1 cooperation\u201d). The class will examine the obstacles that Beijing faces in its effort to use its new-found affinity with the EU to hedge against \u201cAmerican neo-imperialism.\u201d \r\u00a0\u00a0Topic 12. THE VIABILITY AND FUTURE OF \u201cTHE CHINESE MODEL\u201d \r\u00a0There is an intimate connection between China's domestic economic and political achievements on the one hand, and its status and game plans in the global political economy on the other. How viable and sustainable is the \"China model\" -- here understood as not only the country's unique path to economic growth but also the convoluted trajectory of economic and political reforms? The lecture and discussion will focus on reforms introduced by the Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping administrations \u2013 and how they impact on China's ability to make a difference on the world stage. \r\u00a0\u00a0Topic 13. CHINA\u2019S WORLD COMPETITIVENESS, THE \u201cSILICON VALLEY\u201d MODEL, AND \u201cMADE IN CHINA 2025\u201d INITIATIVE\r\u00a0Following the discussion in the previous class on the \"China model,\" this lecture will discuss China's global competitiveness. Students are encouraged to assess the country's unique formula for promoting innovation in government institutions and businesses, including state-own-enterprise conglomerates as well as private firms. Can China nurture a \"Silicon Valley with Chinese characteristics\"? The successful globalization of a selective number of enterprises ranging from Huawei and Haier to Baidu and Alibaba will be analyzed. Premier Li Keqiang\u2019s ambitious \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d program will be examined. Also analyzed will be the diplomatic functions of leading Chinese multinationals as well as their growing international responsibilities.\r\u00a0\u00a0Topic 14.

Over the course of the semester, students will contribute to an ongoing research project (topics vary annually), by performing policy-relevant research, surveying/canvassing, and/or data analysis. Each student is assigned a supervisor who will provide instruction, guidance, and assistance during the internship period. Students are required to submit a final report demonstrating the knowledge outcomes attained: for instance, background knowledge acquisition, experience in practical application of theory, data gathering, and data analysis. The student\u2019s performance will be evaluated on the basis of his/ her final report and the supervisor\u2019s assessment. This course is most similar to Independent Research (GPEC5850); the primary difference is that the focus of this course is on applied research, working with a team and supervised by a leading member of the partnering organizations concerned, while the focus of Independent Research can be more theoretical (e.g., literature review and analysis/interpretation) and is done independently under the supervision of a member of the MGPE teaching staff.", "outcome": "Upon completion of the course, students will be able to:\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0acquire experience working both independently and collaboratively with a team of policy professionals;\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0develop transferable skills for work or further study (e.g. data and policy analysis);\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0better understand how to apply theoretical knowledge to solve social/economic/political challenges and problems; and\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0identify how theoretical knowledge can be improved through empirical research and direct experience.\u00a0", "syllabus": "Learning Activities:\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Supervised work for at least 12 hours per week during the semester;\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0A weekly log detailing students\u2019 work activities and knowledge acquired;\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Write a final report of at least 4,500 words for evaluation", "required_readings": "Reading and research requirements are set at the discretion of the internship coordinator.", "recommended_readings": "", "terms": {"2021-22 Term 2": {"-P01-PRA (1004)": {"startTimes": ["TBA"], "endTimes": ["TBA"], "days": ["TBA"], "locations": ["No Room Required"], "instructors": ["Professor Peter BEATTIE"], "meetingDates": ["10/01/2022 - 02/05/2022"]}}}, "assessments": {"Others": "30", "Report": "70"}}]
