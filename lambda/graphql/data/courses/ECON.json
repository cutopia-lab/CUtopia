Senior students may also be asked to share their experiences in mentorship, internship, and exchange.2. Workshops on academic writing with emphasis on academic honesty. Topics include plagiarism, proper use of source materials, and citation styles. Each student will be asked to write and submit a summary of a collection of articles on a current topic in economics. Feedbacks will be given in a timely manner so that students can correct their errors and resubmit their work. A series of revisions and submissions will finally lead to academically acceptable articles \u2013 writings with clear logic, proper use of source materials, and proper citation style. 3.

Facing the rapid growth of network studies in the economic research, it becomes an attractive and must-know subject for economic undergraduates, particularly when network data are widely available in this big data era. In the first half of this course, we will learn how to describe network data and incorporate network information into the regression analysis. Next, we will discuss how to empirically model peer (spillover) effects in networks and network formation. In the second half of the course, we will cover techniques to obtain and process data for network analysis, as well as machine learning methods commonly used in this area. Throughout this course, students will learn to use two types of software\u2014R and Python\u2014to collect, arrange, and analyze network data. Students will also learn network visualization software such as NetDraw and Gephi to facilitate presentation of analysis results. Students should have knowledge of basic statistics and regression analysis, and are advised to take ECON2121 (or equivalent) and ECON3121 (or equivalent) before taking this course.", "outcome": "1.
