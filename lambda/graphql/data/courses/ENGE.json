Perhaps we are most aware of this kind of creativity when we read imaginative literature, whether classic or contemporary; but we also experience it directly in our own everyday language use. This course aims to foster new understandings of the various ways in which language influences and shapes the experiences of life common to all humanity. Students learn to analyze and appreciate a wide range of literary, linguistic and cultural phenomena, including the works of Hong Kong authors/poets who express themselves through English. From a linguistic perspective, we examine the ways in which language is structured and used creatively for different purposes in both local and global contexts. From a literary perspective, we study not only the traditional genres of fiction, poetry, and drama, but also film, song, and life writing. From a cultural perspective, we investigate how different texts and media are part of how we construct the world and define our evolving sense of self and our common humanity.\r", "outcome": "Upon successful completion of this course students should be better able to:\r\u00a0 - describe the central role of language in the creation and discovery of meaning;\u00a0 - demonstrate a critical appreciation of the ways in which form, structure, and language shape meanings in literary texts;\u00a0 - discuss the historical contexts of the globalization of English and their cultural consequences;\u00a0 - synthesize information and ideas drawn from various sources, and evaluate critically opposing positions;\u00a0 - describe how language and literature express individual and human values within an historical and sociocultural context;\u00a0 - think imaginatively and analytically, and develop creative, ethical solutions to problems;\u00a0 - express ideas with clarity, coherence, creativity, and fluency in both written and oral communication;\u00a0 - use these new understandings as a basis for further studies in the humanities.", "syllabus": "Unit I: Imagination, critical thinking and creative expression through language and literature\r\u00a0\u2022 Conceptions of creativity and critical thinking\r\u00a0\u2022 Imagination and intellectual curiosity\r\u00a0\u2022 Culture and the central role of language and literature in the creation of meaning\r\u00a0\u2022 Language, literature and the study of the humanities\r\u00a0\u00a0Unit II.

The development of the DC and Marvel superheroes of the 80s and 90s built on Asian illustrated traditions and forged new relationships between East and West comics and graphics styles. Today, the genre is among the most dominant cultural forms worldwide. This course will introduce you to the comics and graphic novel literary genre and their movie spin-offs. The course will also have a workshop element and seek graphic and illustrated responses from students. Above all, the course will investigate the role of the superhero. Who is this superhero, or rather what is a superhero? Why does the fantasy of an individual with supernatural powers generate such fascination in modern society? These are some of the questions we will explore during this course. The genre\u2019s transformations over the last nine decades reflect both political, cultural, and social changes. We will explore a broad variety of different superhero incarnations in both film, texts, and graphic novels. Subjects to be discussed include mythology, genre, science and technology, crime and vigilantism, identity, gender and sexuality as well as transnationalism and geopolitics. Anyone interested in popular culture, animation, DC comics, the graphic novel, fantasy and superheroes are welcome to attend this course.\r", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "2150", "title": "Nineteenth-Century Novels on Screen", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "LectureInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of English", "requirements": "", "description": "This course studies the relationship between words on the page and audio-visual moving images on the screen by focusing on the adaptations of classic nineteenth-century novels.

In exploring this dynamic relationship, the field of sociolinguistics focuses on how linguistic variables (e.g., different pronunciation of speech sounds,\r\u00a0word choices, phrases, etc.) and social variables (e.g., age, education, nationality, race, gender, status, power, etc.) influence\r\u00a0each other. As a result, sociolinguists are interested in a wide range of investigations.\r\u00a0\u00a0For example, sociolinguists want to know about language attitudes. In Hong Kong, the attitudes regarding English,\r\u00a0Cantonese, and Putonghua are a major concern in personal, social, educational, economic, and political terms. On a personal\r\u00a0level, Hongkongers may sense a loyalty to Cantonese (language maintenance), causing them some uncertainty about the place of English (post-colonial backlash or positive attitudes toward former British rule) and Putonghua. Likewise, social\r\u00a0interaction, language planning and policy for schools (e.g., EMI, CMI), financial and business interplay between Hong Kong\r\u00a0and China, as well as politically-related issues (e.g., national identity and immigration) affect language attitudes in Hong Kong.\r\u00a0What do we believe about multilingualism in Hong Kong? About the notion of our populace being trilingual and biliterate?\r\u00a0\u00a0Another concern of sociolinguists involves the effect of social situations on language structure. Language contact and\r\u00a0language variation studies focus on special varieties of languages (codes) that arise (pidgins) and may then evolve (creoles)\r\u00a0when speakers from mutually unintelligible language groups interact, needing a common code for communication. In\r\u00a0addition to language structure, other key social and linguistic information\u2014language change, code switching/code mixing,\r\u00a0language policy and planning\u2014can be studied.\r\u00a0\u00a0Language in use is another area that sociolinguists study. Stylistic choices that are made due to social relationships and\r\u00a0settings/contexts reflect valuable insights into how language operates in relation to social rules and cultural values, involving\r\u00a0norms of politeness, deference, status, and power. Associated areas of study are conversational analysis (examination of how\r\u00a0people talk with each other, taking turns and selecting topics, making jokes, etc.), and gender and language (exploration of\r\u00a0inter- and intra-gender communication issues).\r\u00a0\u00a0Clearly, language, culture, and society are intimately connected, each one influencing the others.

Given that\u00a0discourse analysis is concerned with the systematic and careful examination of a variety of texts, this course will be\u00a0organized according to the various ways linguists may interpret the notion of text.\u00a0This semester, we begin with a general review of discourse analysis as a field of linguistic study. Then, we follow that\u00a0discussion with an overview of various rhetorical and linguistic approaches to the analysis of texts as written discourse,\u00a0examining non-fiction (essays) and literary texts. Our stylistic analyses of writing includes the study of rhetorical aspects\u00a0(aims, purpose, rhetorical situation, style, discourse blocs, modes of development, voice/persona, tone, attitude, and\u00a0readability) and syntactic matters (i.e., lexical, phrasal, and clausal use). With an understanding of this approach, we use it to\u00a0analyze student-written essays; in addition, we consider what our findings may suggest about the texts and their writers,\u00a0with a view to identifying strategies for possible rewriting and revising.\u00a0Moving from text as written discourse, we adopt a broad notion of the term text as both written and spoken discourse. Primarily\u00a0using the work of text-linguists, we consider structures \u201cbeyond the sentence.\u201d That is, we now view the idea of a text as\u00a0any passage, either spoken or written, of whatever length, that forms a unified whole; and we consider what makes a text\u00a0\u201cgood\u201d or \u201csuccessful\u201d in terms of information flow (the way ideas are dispersed throughout a text) , coherence (global\u00a0concern that indicates a text is unified), and cohesion (local or surface concern that serve to link one idea and sentence to\u00a0the next one in a text). Again, once we complete some cohesion and information flow analyses, we look at practical ways\u00a0we might apply some of the key ideas in teaching and learning situations in Hong Kong.\u00a0Finally, we conclude with the notion of text as talking\u2014oral exchanges. We will analyze naturally-occurring language in use, i.e.,\u00a0conversational analysis and pragmatics. To do so, we will cover such concepts such as the Gricean maxims and the\u00a0Cooperative Principle (rules and conditions which speakers abide by in effective or \u201chappy\u201d exchanges), implicature\u00a0(indirect meaning), speech acts (social act performed by the uttering of certain words), as well as associated phenomenon\u00a0(e.g., framing, turn-taking, overlap, interruption, adjacency pairs, etc. ). Our study of text as talk will enable us to explore\u00a0how and why people \u201cdo\u201d things with words, sometimes successfully and sometimes not.\u00a0By the end of the course, we hope to have a better understanding of how discourse analysis reveals to us the intricacies of a\u00a0text as well as enhances our knowledge of how such analysis can strengthen our abilities as language users\u2014speakers and\u00a0writers.", "required_readings": "Discourse Analysis Readings.
