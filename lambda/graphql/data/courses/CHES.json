Students will be asked to reflect on the way traumas are remembered, and to which use historical events are put in different contexts.

After offering an overview of modern China's quest for urbanization since the late imperial era, this course will focus on the massive and rapid urbanizing process in the post-reform era. Students will be exposed to diverse issues, such as migration, population control, land policy, housing reform, urban planning, spatial reconfiguration, social welfare, inner-city poverty, infrastructure and transportation, environmental protection, and public space. The readings, drawn from multiple disciplines such as economics, sociology, anthropology, history, political science, and urban studies will examine the socioeconomic, political and cultural factors that contribute to the process and its particularities in the late-socialist context.
