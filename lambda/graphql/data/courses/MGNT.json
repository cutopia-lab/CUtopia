While in the past the international arena has been limited to large multinational corporations and even some large companies have only been active in their local market, today increasingly many companies, both small and large, engage in business which transcends geographic, political, and cultural boundaries. Thus, for most firms international business is no longer an option it is a must.Differences between countries such as cultural differences and institutional differences have important implications for the optimal way to conduct business in a country. Although the world is becoming more global, today more than ever people have an expectation that foreigners doing business in their country have an understanding of what management practices are normally used locally, and organizational behavior is still strongly influenced by people\u2019s cultural background. To be successful in this global economy, a manager must understand the effect diverse cultures have on how organizations work and be capable of managing multiple cultures interacting\u2014two skills this course will seek to develop. The course is highly interactive using case studies and simulations as well as interactive lectures and discussions to facilitate learning. This course will help prepare people planning to work in large and small firms alike to be senior executives making important international business decisions and acting as an effective international manager. Most managers agree that international business is not easy. Thus, we will learn strategies to make the internationalization process easier, and we will develop an understanding of the different modes of entry which are at our disposal and when different modes are preferable. This course will also study mergers and acquisitions which are becoming increasingly important in our world today. The course will explore key strategies for international business and also investigate how to interact with people from different countries most effectively, how to work on multicultural teams effectively, how to be an effective leader in different countries, and how to conduct international negotiations. We will also study how to deal with complexity and deal with multiple tasks at the same time which is an important challenge that international managers face. The course will also explore key design, management, and strategy issues multinational companies face. While this course will focus on international business broadly, for part of the course we will take a deep dive into how to do business in mainland China as an example of international business.
