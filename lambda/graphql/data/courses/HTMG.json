The course provides a systematic overview of fundamental OB concepts, theories, and applications in the context of hospitality, tourism, and real estate businesses. We will discuss a variety of topics at three levels. First, we will study how individuals differ in their personality traits, values, attitudes, emotions, perceptions, and motivations. Second, we will examine how people interact with one another and work in groups and teams. Topics range from team dynamics, group decision making, power and influence, to conflict management. Leadership theories and practices will also be discussed. Third, we will discuss how organizational-level factors such as organizational culture and change affect attitudes, behaviors, and work performances of employees. The OB concepts and theories are closely related to HRM. Through the course students will learn how to apply OB theories to improve HRM effectiveness in a variety of areas, e.g., job design and analysis, employee recruitment and selection, training and socialization, employee performance appraisal, compensation and benefits, and organizational culture formation and maintenance. Students will also learn what characteristics, behaviors, attitudes, and competencies define good leadership and how to ensure successful organizational changes through effectively motivating employees.

The hospitality sector has been quick to embrace \u201cbrand\u201d in this regard recognizing that these qualities offer the greatest means of competitive advantage. Thus, to not only succeed but to thrive in a competitive landscape, hotels and other service brands in the wider hospitality sector, need to stand out by \u201cstanding for\u201d something.

The success of SHTM education hinges on our ability to connect theory to practice. (Incidentally, this is also the education philosophy at Cornell. For many years, according to Dean Michael Johnson, this has been the key to set Cornell Hotel School apart from practically all other hotel schools.) This is a course to enable you to develop a framework to connect theory to practice. There are two specific course objectives:\r\u00a0The first objective is to show you how an academic mind shapes an executive mind. We all want to become successful executives. A successful executive is someone who has an executive mind. An executive mind makes effective and efficient decisions. In the meantime, we come to study at a leading university because we want to master the best way to learn how to learn. The best learner is someone who has an academic mind. An academic mind has a firm grasp of literature and knows how to learn from current and historic great minds from different disciplines. When we have an academic mind that can guide our executive mind, we can benefit from literature and make well informed effective and efficient decisions. In this course, we introduce to you a way to see theories through daily actions and to see the relationship between theory and practice. Whenever a practice is highly significant, it pays to go to the root of the practice and make sure that there is a sound theory behind. In the meantime, in implementation, a sound practice will ensure that there is a thorough understanding of the sound theory behind. Theory and practice are two sides of the same coin. In the past two years, you have spent considerable amount of time to gain practical exposure in the hospitality or real estate industries. They include site visits, distinguished speaker series, courses in Executive-in-Residence program, and most important of all, summer internships. All these are precious experiences. When you have an academic mind to distil your experience and link it to a theoretical framework, you will become much more powerful to make good use of your experience to accelerate learning. Experience without learning is hardship. Experience with learning generates personal satisfaction and growth. Learning hinges on whether one has an academic mind, the way to develop the ability to learn how to learn. The ideal of education at SHTM is to enable us to see the implication of a theory to improving practices and also to see a theory behind proven best practices. It is only possible when we have an academic mind.\r\u00a0\u00a0The second objective is to show you how to nurture an academic mind, the way to develop your ability to learn how to learn. We enable you to appreciate the beauty of the process to develop a body of scientific knowledge in business and social science in the context of the hospitality and real estate industries. This will give you an orientation to appreciate the contribution to literature from various business and social science disciplines, the challenge of problems in the hospitality and real estate industries, the nature of empirical evidence, the importance of journals, books, magazines and libraries, and the meaning of academic work. A university graduate is someone with an academic mind, someone who can make a good connection and grow together with the living and past giants from all walks of life. Those with an academic mind who decide to practise in the industries will be able to make executive decisions with a deep meaning. Those with an academic mind who have a passion in knowledge pursuit may later decide to go for an academic career and contribute directly to the body of scientific knowledge.\r\u00a0\u00a0Theory construction is the foundation of academic disciplines. This conduct of inquiry prevails across a wide spectrum of courses in the whole curriculum. Thus, when you have established yourself in this course, you will also strengthen your capability of academic pursuit in many other courses. Some students may wonder why we do not teach this course earlier. A straight forward answer is if students do not have enough background (subject matter and work experience), they do not have the ability to learn in this course. Thus, there is no way to teach this course earlier. Some students may also wonder since they are already senior students when they take this course, there will be no chance for them to make use of the knowledge in this course to strengthen their capability of academic pursuit in other courses. A straight forward answer is academic pursuit is life long. One will revisit different course materials from time to time even long after graduation. After all, the main purpose of university education is to assist students to become independent learners during and after their university study. As a matter of fact, their independent learning ability will dictate their chance of success as a leader in the society. While students nurture the independent learning ability mainly during their university study (normally lasting for three to four years), most of their independent learning actually happens after graduation (normally lasting for 50 to 60 years).", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": "", "terms": {"2020-21 Term 1": {"A-LEC (5704)": {"startTimes": ["9:30"], "endTimes": ["12:15"], "days": [2], "locations": ["Leung Kau Kui Bldg 101"], "instructors": ["Professor WAN Chun Ying"]}}, "2020-21 Term 2": {"B-LEC (6411)": {"startTimes": ["9:30"], "endTimes": ["12:15"], "days": [2], "locations": ["Science Centre L2"], "instructors": ["Professor WAN Chun Ying"]}}}, "assessments": {"Others": "0", "Presentation": "0"}}, {"code": "5001", "title": "Real Estate Finance", "career": "Postgraduate - Taught", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "Lecture", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Div of Business Administration", "requirements": "For students in MSc in Management of Real Estate and Hospitality Assets", "description": "The turmoil in real estate market, which is one of the largest and most important components of the financial system, could bring a negative impact to the world financial markets.
