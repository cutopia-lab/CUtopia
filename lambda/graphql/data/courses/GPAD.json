These theories were selected because of their direct relevance for developing an understanding of modern government behaviour. \u00a0 Public administration is often considered in a managerial manner, as little more than control and straightforward analysis of efficiency and economy. This is not necessarily the case. People from different walks of life tend to have different expectations of government. This course is intended to foster a change in attitudes among students. After the course, students are expected to have the ability and tendency to think critically from multidisciplinary perspectives and to provide a critical appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of any theoretical approach. Most important of all, by taking this course, students should have developed an understanding of the basic concepts and theories in public administration and should have gained the ability to apply them to the context of Hong Kong. Public administration, as an area of study, is very much a study based in American context. Therefore, it is important for students to reflect on the concepts and approaches covered in the course, and to consider how they can contribute to a better understanding of public administration in Hong Kong. The course is intended to reinforce communication skills on the part of students. Through the training in debates and discussions, students should have developed the ability to convey abstract ideas and complicated issues in a concrete and organized manner.", "syllabus": "Teaching Plan and Readings (* required readings)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Part I.

The general backdrop of the course is the development of what has been called the \u2018regulatory state\u2019 emerging in the era of privatisation since the early 1980s, and the term \u2018risk society\u2019 coined in the 1990s in the debate of modernisation. Over the past decades, the transferred role of states from positive service provider to regulator and the regulation of risk have attracted intense scrutiny from social scientists. In the discipline of political science, the main academic debates focus on the design of regulatory regimes, tools and strategies deployed, the regulation of risk in different socio-economic and political institutional settings, and the interactive dynamics between regulators and other actors inside the \u2018regulatory space\u2019.

The notion of \u2018governance\u2019 has taken shape out of the fact that governments are now facing a much more limited role in supplying public goods and organising societies. Their activities and decisions have been increasingly transferred to the private sector, NGOs, quangos and international organisations, even to the extent that public policy has been \u2018hollowed out\u2019. As such, this course depicts a general picture of contextual challenges confronting governments in public policy. The features and effects of globalisation, regionalization, marketisation, privatisation and the dynamism of civil society are discussed. In addition, the course discusses the ways in which governments have attempted to cope with these contextual uncertainties. Faced with the changing context, governments in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century are developing new mechanisms to influence populations. These new mechanisms contain: rationality, regulation, surveillance, risk and moral politics. While governments have undergone change, they may be more or less powerful than in the past.\r", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "2095", "title": "Public Policy Workshop", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "LectureInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of Govern & Public Admin", "requirements": "Prerequisite: GPAD1050.", "description": "Public policy-making is a nexus amalgamating concepts from many disciplines in action.

To catalyze your learning, this course will provide practical and contemporary examples throughout the course. Part I of the course provides a brief historical background to European politics and sets the scene for the course. The course starts out by examining how and why the European Union was formed alongside the traditional political landscape in Europe that is largely considered as stable in terms of voting and political behavior. Important theoretical concepts are introduced in Part I of the course, in examining theoretically how contemporary 'populism' is defined and conceptualized in the 21st century political landscape. Two divergent concepts, in the form of (a) right-wing populism and (b) left-wing populism are introduced, with key examples from contemporary European politics drawn on to further enhance students' learning.Students are then introduced to the key theoretical debates on populism in the academic literature and are allowed to make critical evaluations about how they themselves will define populism as a political ideology.Part II of the course provides the main focus of the course, in focusing on the main causes and drivers that have led to the growth of (a) radical right-wing populism and (b) radical left-wing populism.Three key approaches are drawn on in Part II of the course, with comparative studies, survey research (public opinion) and case studies across Western Europe and Central-Eastern Europe allowing students to understand about the diversity and variations of populism in the contemporary political landscape. Students are then introduced to an important case study in the form of the landmark 2016 Brexit vote.Flipped classroom learning will be adopted here, with students watching and then having a critical debate based on a special documentary and discussing the role that radical right-wing populism and Euroscepticism has played in the Brexit vote and the future of the British political system. Students will also be tasked to work in groups and make group project presentations on a topic of their choice that relates to populism.Part III of the course introduces students to critical debates and evaluations on the 'rise' of populism and just how important understanding this political phenomenon is for (a) the implications for contemporary democracy and governance in EU member states, alongside (b) how populism on the 'right' and 'left' of the political spectrum is challenging the future EU project. Students are provided with a unique learning experience, with a practical and special Data Lab session that allows them to understand the root causes of populism, through a series of applied public opinion surveys (drawing on the Eurobarometer) and data analysis.The final part of the course also allows students to understand the wider roots that right-wing and left-wing populism has had in shaking up the contemporary political landscape. Latest articles from academic research alongside newspaper and op-ed articles will be deployed to further enhance the overall student learning experience. In particular, the 'rise' of populist parties on the left and right will be linked to the electoral decline of mainstream social democratic parties in Europe.Students will also be provided with a Special Guest Lecture, with a key speaker (European expert) from the Europe Asia Policy Centre for Comparative Research (EAP) coming in to share their own personal experiences, in outlining the role that populism has played in challenging the governance of the European Union and its key institutions. This session will also allow students to further their understanding of how the European Union works and most importantly allow students to ask questions from the guest speaker and further enhance their overall learning experience in an interactive setting. Students are also encouraged to draw on their own personal backgrounds and experience, in drawing on comparisons and making links between the causes of 'populism' in the European context, to the causes of 'localism' in the Hong Kong context.The final part of the course also revisits the premise and assumption made in Part I of the course, about the historical stability of the European political landscape by outlining how 'a new form of politics' now exists in European politics. Stability and patterns of partisan alignment have now been replaced by instability and widespread patterns of electoral volatility. Thus, by the end of the course students will able to trace the historical evolution of European Politics and most importantly, the challenges that a number of contemporary European Union (EU) countries are facing in terms of their governance amidst the 'rise' of populist radical right and left-wing parties alike in the 21st century.\r", "outcome": "By the end of the course, students should be able to:\r\u00a0\u2022 Understand what contemporary 'populism' is and the different variants of this political ideology (Populist Radical Right-Wing and Populist Radical Left-Wing Parties)\r\u00a0\u2022 Understand the primary 'causes' that have led to the rise in electoral support for populist parties on both the right and left of the political spectrum\r\u00a0\u2022 Understand how the governance of a number of European countries is currently under threat, with events such as the 'rise' of populism, the landmark 2016 Brexit vote ('Euroscepticism'), the Migration/Immigration Crisis, the economic crisis and the decline of social democratic parties in 21st century Europe\r\u00a0\u2022 Students will also gain a comprehensive understanding of data analysis, through a 3 hour lab session, which draws on the latest public opinion and survey data (the Eurobarometer dataset), which further illustrates the 'rise' of populism in Europe", "syllabus": "This course would be divided into three separate parts to enhance student learning.
