The growing interest in empathy, wellness and resilience has fuelled the design and implementation of structured educational programmes worldwide to cultivate empathy especially at a time of increasing professional burnout among undergraduates and resident trainees.Empathy in the medical setting includes the appreciation of the patient\u2019s emotions and the expression of that awareness. Empathy is an essential learning objective and it is believed to significantly influence patient satisfaction, adherence to medical recommendations, clinical outcomes, and professional satisfaction.A key component to empathy is reflective capacity. Fostering reflective capacity within medical education helps develop critical thinking skills inform clinical reasoning, and enhance professionalism among trainees. Development of reflective capacity has been highlighted as necessary for effective use of feedback in medical education and is an essential aspect of self-regulated and lifelong learning. Failure to reflect on one\u2019s own thinking processes, including critical examination of one\u2019s assumptions, beliefs, and conclusions, was recently described as a cognitive component of \u201cphysician overconfidence,\u201d a contributing cause of diagnostic error in medicine.Reflection is not necessarily intuitive, especially in students at initial stages of their medical careers.The over-arching aim of the course is to nurture and consolidate the key soft skills of an effective doctor, as well as healthy resilient personality through the development of reflective capacity and empathy.The course is delivered in progressive stages to build reflective capacity and empathy in specific professional developmental contexts. The four building blocks as outlined below will be emphasized in different years. The building blocks will be progressively built and integrated over curriculum from year 2 to year 4.1. Empathic Engagement (Year 2)2. Doctor and Society (Year 3)3. Doctor and Self- Reflection in Practice (Year 4)4.

The course is delivered in progressive stages to build reflective capacity and empathy in specific professional developmental contexts. The four building blocks as outlined below will be emphasized in different years. The building blocks will be progressively built and integrated over the curriculum from year 2 to year 4.1. Empathic Engagement (Year 2)2. Doctor and Society (Year 3) 3. Doctor and Self- Reflection in Practice (Year 4)4. Doctor and Profession (Year 4)The four components encompass the core values of a healthy and competent doctor who is able to foster a therapeutic alliance with patients, appreciate and reflect the meaning of work, being a team player as well as connection with public and society.After completing the course MEDU3160 in Year 3, students are expected to build the reflective capacity on mapping their external and internal resources as well as develop sensitivity to connect with the society as a knowledgeable, caring and professional physician. Medical students are also expected to explore more about self and teamwork in a clinical environment with a good sense of professionalism. A clinical medical setting is a teamwork environment with multidisciplinary professionals, e.g. doctors, nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, who must work together, communicate frequently, and have a common goal to care for the patients. The World Health Organization (WHO) also recommends medical students to learn the principles of teamwork in their training. Moreover, nowadays, the work duty of a doctor is heavily loaded, physically and emotionally. The development of regular self-reflection in practice would help the students to enhance resilience in managing stress. In this course, Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) will be used as a tool to help the students to reflect on how their values, needs, and personality traits greatly influence the helping process and style. Apart from MBTI, Mindfulness is recognized by the leading Medical Schools worldwide as a beneficial practice for their students and residents. Mindfulness is cultivated to promote self-care, self-awareness, and empathy with the ultimate aim of mutually improving the well\u2013being of doctors-in-training and for the long term patient care with good quality. The course covers 3 different themes for students to explore and reflect. It includes:a. being an effective team player and negotiator; b. understanding personality type and professional Care Style through Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI); andc. Mindfulness and Cognitive techniques for medical students.\r", "outcome": "After completing the course, students are able to:\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 acquire basic negotiation and helping skills in crisis scenes related to work settings \u00a0\u2022 have higher self-awareness and understanding of their own Care Style, based on their 16 MBTI personality type preferences\u00a0\u2022 have specific recommendations on how they can flex their particular Care Style to increase patient\u2019s satisfaction\u00a0\u2022 reflect on how their individual personality type preferences affect the teamwork, communication and potential source of stress in clinical setting \u00a0\u2022 involve in the discussions relating to the professional issues, practical situations and attitudes necessary for the professionals\u00a0\u2022 reflect their clinical experiences through peer review, constructive feedback and consultation by the medical professional\u00a0\u2022 acquire and apply basic mindfulness and cognitive techniques", "syllabus": "The course is divided into three parts which aim to engage students' active participation and self-reflection. \u00a0\u00a0Part 1: Being an effective team player and negotiator \u00a0- Teamwork in health care setting \u00a0- Introduction to negotiation and helping skills\u00a0- Group discussion \u00a0\u00a0Part 2: Understanding personality type and professional Care Style though MBTI \u00a0- Introduction of MBTI\u00a0- Online questionnaire assessment \u00a0- Interpretation of MBTI result, Care Style and recommendations to self-development\u00a0 \u00a0Part 3: Mindfulness and Cognitive techniques for medical students", "required_readings": "N/A", "recommended_readings": "Teamwork and Negotiation:\u00a0\u00a0World Health Organization.
