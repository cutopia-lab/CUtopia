During the course students will discuss the nature of morality and a number of important approaches to moral education, and then compare these to other types of values education.

The social and policy environment after 1997 is exerting a great impact on education. Part of this impact is that teachers risk facing litigations or their rights being evaded if they are not careful and guarded enough in their daily school lives. In order to reduce these risks, this module will introduce some of the most significant legal issues that arise in primary and secondary schools and their implications for teachers. The module will: i) explore evolving legal standards on a variety of issues including employment, school safety, student discipline, student well-being, infringement of copyright, free speech, services for students with special education needs and non-Chinese learners, sexual harassment, and violence and bullying; ii) examine educational, political, ethical, and administrative questions that legal issues often generate; iii) draw on real cases and legal/policy dilemmas that teachers are facing; and iv) provide teachers with knowledge and skills they need to make sound decisions, advance important educational objectives, and minimize legal problems.(Individual course teachers may update the grade descriptors as and whenever necessary.

Shifting expectations require teachers to have a firm understanding of how schools operate and how reforms affect their roles both in and outside of the classroom. To effectively reshape their work in line with growing expectations teachers must commit to career long professional development and consider strategies for maximizing their effectiveness, especially in terms of learning and teaching. This course is designed to help teachers to understand and shape their roles in a reform environment. In other words it aims to help teachers to become leaders of their own professionalism. It does this in two ways, first it helps teachers understand life in schools undergoing reform and the effect this can have on their professional life. Topics covered in this area include organizational culture, micropolitics, organizational behaviour and teacher leadership. The second thrust aims to nurture teacher awareness of their own professional growth and how they can maximize the latest opportunities available in this area.
