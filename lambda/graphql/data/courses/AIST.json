We start the course by introducing the problem-solving paradigm with deep learning: data preparation, building the model, training the model, model evaluation, and hyper-parameter searching. Then, we fill in the details in the paradigm. Regarding the deep learning models, we will go from the simplest linear regression model, towards the relatively complicated models. To handle various data types, that is, the structured data, images, text, sequences, signals, and graphs, in our daily life, we would cover CNN/ResNet, RNN/LSTM, Attention, and GNN models. In addition to the above paradigms, we will also cover the commonly used techniques to handle overfitting. We would briefly go through the generative models, VAE, and GAN, at the end of this course.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "1000", "title": "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "1.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "LectureProject", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of Computer Sci & Engg", "requirements": "", "description": "This course covers the basic concepts, problems, approaches and applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
