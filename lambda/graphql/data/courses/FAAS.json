Usage of 3D scanner and printer will be introduced and practiced. The final piece should be a combination of hand-crafted and digital forming.\r\u00a0\u00a05. The Container & the Contained\r\u00a0A tailor-made container / box will be constructed to house the sculptural form developed in the previous stages. Relevant images as well as different materials / textures will be explored and eventually applied onto the container / box to further reference the conceptual development of the sculptural form. Usage of appropriate tools and machinery will be introduced and practiced.", "required_readings": "As it is a studio course, no specific reading is required; the teacher will provide reference and reading material to students from time to time.", "recommended_readings": "1.

Unfortunately, with the enormous temporal and geographical difference, both the Nature and the \u201cheart-source\u201d of the ancient masters, as well as their techniques in articulating the two, appear to be unapproachable to us living in the modern age. Likewise, the field\u2019s ambiguous meta-language full of expressions like \u201c\u6c23\u97fb\u751f\u52d5\u201d (infusing ch\u2019i to show life movement) or \u201c\u610f\u8da3\u201d (subtle charm resulted from spontaneity) can also be a hurdle to uninitiated students.Distant it might seem, art, after all, is inspired by real life.

A field trip will be organized and students will be walked through the areas of Shanghai, Suzhou and Hangzhou where the Ming Dynasty painters were active in.

The presumption that artist cannot contribute significantly to public sector is questionable nowadays\u2014there are many experiments being done to show that artistic intervention can somehow arouse the awareness of hidden power and political structure of the society. As a citizen or an artist, art has a role to play in public space.Seeing public space as an arena for artistic expression becomes another focus in contemporary art. Gallery, museum which are supposed to be neutral space in showing art is gradually replaced by space with cultural significances; message in art has been put into specific context for holistic examination. The course will cover various art forms in public space, which include traditionally defined public art, such as sculpture and functional objects in public space.
