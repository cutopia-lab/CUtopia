This course exposes students to a range of state-of-the-arts developments in biomedical engineering. It invites students from various disciplines to discuss the long-term societal impacts and ethical implications of these technological advances, particularly in human enhancements beyond therapy. The course starts by illustrating the many amazing designs in our human body and yet how vulnerable we are in terms of injuries, diseases and ageing. Examples on how modern biomedical engineering helps us face our human conditions are given, such as musculoskeletal prosthetics and orthotics, cardiovascular implants, neuroengineering, stem cells and regenerative medicine, gene editing, bionanotechnology, intelligence and artificial intelligence and senses and artificial senses, etc. A historical account of human quest for \u201cliving\u201d machine, including a brief coverage of modern movies on bionic human then follows. The course wraps up with some social, ethical and philosophical reflections on the above issues and on the meaning of being human, opening up questions concerning the perennial human quest of becoming super human.\r", "outcome": " Upon successful completion of the subject, students will be able to:  Describe some of the amazing designs in human body & their potential damages due to injuries, diseases, & ageing;  Give examples on how engineering has helped in reconstructing damaged body parts and/or body functions, such as musculoskeletal prosthetics, cardiovascular implants, artificial sight, tissue & genetic engineering, etc.;  Reflect on our human imagination about the bionic human of the future; and  Discuss some of the philosophical, societal and ethical issues associated with such technological development. Higher-Order Learning and Literacy: Students will be given sets of thematic reading assignments (listed as common reading requirements in the Reading List and Reference section), and asked to question, discuss, and illustrate their readings using some instructor-prepared worksheets as guides. Throughout the subject, students will be drawn to reflect on their views on the distinct characteristics of being human. Each student is expected to critically review one of the selected books (given in the Reading List, total reading not less than 200 pages) in a book report (~2,500 words). Life-Long Learning: In this interdisciplinary subject, students will be constantly facilitated and drilled to learn across their disciplines. We regard such an interdisciplinary learning capacity an important skill for life-long learning.", "syllabus": " Human life is both amazing and vulnerable. Amazing \u2013 the designs and working of our human bodies are the envies of engineering science. Vulnerable \u2013 the best and the strongest are still mortal. We are susceptible to trauma, diseases, ageing and finally death. Advances in life science and engineering are bringing to us in fast cadence and big strides innovative breakthroughs and new possibilities in healing and rejuvenation, functional recoveries and health enablement. Powered intelligent prostheses for subjects with amputation, fully implantable artificial hearts for subjects with heart failures, tissue engineered skin for severely burnt subjects, stem cells therapies for impaired brain tissues are examples that our body can be fixed by replacing the defective components with artificial \u201cspare parts\u201d and other augmentative measures. At the same time, research laboratories are developing intelligent robots that can see, hear, smell, talk, walk, dance, think, and feel like human \u2013 following a centuries-long human quest for \u201cliving\u201d machines. The mechanistic implications of these biomedical and engineering advances seem apparent \u2013 Is human a robot? Can robot one day become human? The artists among us are quick to perceive and even exploit these implications. The entertainment media have imaginatively presented many kinds of human-robotic hybrids, both as heroes and villains, often with power and abilities beyond those of a human. What could we tell about ourselves from our quests, pursuits, and dreams? How may one define the borderline between human and robot? What does it mean to be a human? \u00a0         Course Syllabus      Week    Session-1    Session-2    Session-3      \u00a01    Introduction  Course Management    Amazing & Vulnerable Human    YouTube Channels \u2013 Human Enhancement      State of Science in Biomedical Engineering      \u00a02    DVD: Understanding Stem Cells    Lecture:\u00a0DNA Engineering    Artificial Intelligence      \u00a03    DVD: The Brain: Episode 3 \u2013 Who is in control?
