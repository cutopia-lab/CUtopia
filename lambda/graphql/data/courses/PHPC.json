Students can gain first-hand experiences and grasp certain practical skills by conducting the field studies in Hong Kong, China and other areas. Environmental health is about how the environmental factors may adversely impact the public health and what we can do to prevent or minimize these impacts. By the scale, the hazards can be local (e.g., industrial and household pollution, traffic exhaust), regional (e.g., deteriorating regional air quality), or global (e.g., climate change); by the relationship to social development, the hazards can be traditional (e.g., household hygiene) or modern (e.g., new chemicals). Without field studies, the students may have difficulties in understand the broad scopes of environmental health practice. This course is to fill in this gap by conducting local and regional field studies and equipping the students with practical skills (e.g., air sampling techniques) in environmental monitoring, risk assessment and management. Students are first required to select a study topic of interest, for example air pollution and respiratory diseases, water pollution and metal industry, and social development and sustainability, and then to review literature, to collect information from the places visited, and to write up a final report.This course will be held during term breaks under the supervision of one or more faculty members.
