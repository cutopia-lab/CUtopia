The store of ancient wisdom accumulated in various cultures is oftentimes still relevant to our contemporary contexts.

Through guided reading of selected passages from the religious classics, students may draw from the well of profound wisdom to stimulate their reflection on the approach of life, the way of looking at the world, and the recurring issues facing humanity. Texts selected for reading may include Zhuangzi, the Lotus Sutra, the Bible and the Quran, the Bhagavad G\u012bt\u0101, and so forth.
