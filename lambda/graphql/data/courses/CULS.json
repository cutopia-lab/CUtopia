This course aims to examine the historical trajectory of queer movements as well as the issues and debates pertinent to them so as to make sense of the complexity of sexual politics in the late modern society. It also poses challenges to the commonly held division between academy and social activism by examining their intertwined but not very smooth relationship. To that end, the course will draw on the works of lesbian and gay historians such as Lillian Faderman, Jeffrey Weeks, John D\u2019Emilio and Michel Foucault to lay a social constructionist framework through which the emergence of polymorphous sexual subjects is understood. The social construction of homosexuality in Hong Kong since the 1980s will be discussed as a case in point. The works of Diana Fuss, Judith Butler and Eve Segewick will guide us to explore the internal dilemma of identity politics and the queer turn in the study of sexuality.", "outcome": "1.

In the course of teaching, three aspects will be highlighted including the critical, functional and practical aspects, and students\u2019 ability for critical exchanges and practical writing training in film criticism will be emphasized.

In other words, gender and sexuality is the production of \u201cself\u201d structured and motivated by various kinds of sociopolitical, cultural, racial and historical forces. Engaging the configuration of gender, sexual identity and body politics by Butler as well as other queer theorists such as Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Judith Halberstam, Mary Ann Doane and Marjorie Garber, this course is designed to investigate the cross-dressing and the gender-crossing of Hong Kong cinema in comparison with Western filmmaking. We will study the cross-dressers and their visual representations in both Chinese and Western cinema. Issues addressed include the historical construction of cross-dressing, the redefinition of masculinity and femininity of transvestites, the queer spectatorship of audience reception, gay and lesbian identities, homophobia and heterosexism, transsexualism and the discourse of AIDS.

These challenges are now raising concerns both from scholars in the natural science and from the humanities and the social sciences. This course works on a rapidly growing field of Enviornmental Humanities constituted by the work of scholars from a wide variety of disciplines including history, literature, philosophy, cultural studies, religion studies, arts.It aims to provide students with some recent methodological and theoretical approaches of understanding the anthropocene, including cultural ecology, environmental history, science studies, poststructuralist cultural studies, and eco-feminism.

Leaving Zootopia \u2013 Revitalizing Animals in the City (Lecture C1-C4)\u00a0Each area covers a set of animal issue discussion. Area A, apart from theorizing animal with cultural studies, tackles the basic animal issues: pet-nurturing, zoo-building, forest-sustaining and tourism. This is to provide a foundation for understanding animals with a critical reflection of everyday life. \u00a0\u00a0Area B, set with the concern of media, discusses issues of animal representation in animation, cinema, literature and journalism. This is to read how animals would be represented and how this affects human understanding and related policy-making. \u00a0\u00a0Area C further deals with the matters of animal-city relationship in seeing how dogs and cats, cattle and swine, and fishes and dolphins are (mal)treated in the street, the farm and the sea respectively.

For each topic, students will be introduced with theoretical concepts, narrative and representations involved. Students will also get to know some key scholars involved in the discussion. Not shun from taking position, students are encouraged to keep open-minded and evaluate the issues critically, particularly to treat the discourses as ongoing process rather than static products.

An operating premise of the course is that global film industries are rapidly consolidating, and while popular East Asian films remain distinctive, they do so in a marketplace of rising expectations, in storytelling, technical polish, and sophisticated promotion. While we take into account culturally special features, we will emphasize the ways these films engage with international frameworks of entertainment, and how these frameworks are changing. By the end of the course, you should be able to: 1) identify key features of East Asian popular films; 2) reflect clearly on these in relation to film industries and in conjunction with mainstream entertainment in the West; 3) show evidence of original thinking in framing questions of popularity in any medium (method of approach).", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "5404", "title": "Fashion and Visuality", "career": "Postgraduate - Taught", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "LectureInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Div of Cultural Studies", "requirements": "For taught postgraduate students under Division of Cultural Studies", "description": "This course introduces students to the visualization and spectatorship of fashion culture.

A central concern is to transform Chinese visual arts into both modern and Chinese, representing an independent people and nation marching into modernity. Developed around the visual arts, the course would ultimately like to ask a political question: is there a national style? This course focuses primarily on the Chinese arts, but we will also pay attention to artistic movements outside China. We will explore different genres of visual arts as well as the overall social and political order of the time. In contrast to the traditional art history approach, this course is devoted to the investigation of how arts and politics became so mutually constitutive with each other in the Chinese context, and how the revolution discourse relied heavily on the arts to connect to the people. We will also explore how Maoist arts cannot be understood simply as political tool. In addition to providing a general overview of the development of arts, we will also investigate the meanings of artistic freedom in China, and explore the identity of artists and authors under an official ideology in which collectivity is deemed much more important than individuals. At a time when nationalism perpetuates Chinese society, a revisit of the \u201cnational style\u201d of Chinese arts developed in the twentieth century invites students to reflect on the meanings of Chinese arts beyond narrow-minded Sino-centric frameworks. We could instead go back to some basic aesthetic values and concepts such as emancipation, democracy, and plurality.

The new field of studies considers ontological ideas about the relationship between humans and 'things'. In her book Vibrant Matter (2011), political theorist Jane Bennett argues that non-human forces actively participate in socio-economic and political process, and that matters or \u201cthings\u201d possess power that is not reducible to human meanings. This course asks students to throw away old conceptualization that human makes things and history. It turns the question around to ask how \u201cthings\u201d make people and how to have a new imagination of world politics and social justice based on new connection between human and non-human \u201cthings.\u201d Can things, such as technology, corporeality and matters be understood as having a form of subjectivity, being, and agency of their own? Can we think of a new way of understanding the social with non-human \u201cthings?\u201d", "outcome": "By the end of the course, students should have the necessary skills and knowledge to:\r\u00a0- understand key concepts in material cultural study about things and their relations with modernity.\r\u00a0- understand the boundaries between things as object and subject, gift and commodity, art and artifact.\r\u00a0- read across disciplinary boundaries between anthropology, sociology and philosophy.", "syllabus": "- The Social Life of Things\r\u00a0- The Fetish or the Illusory Agency of the Object\r\u00a0- On Materiality\r\u00a0- Beyond Objects, Beyond Subjects\r\u00a0- Capitalism and Commodities\r\u00a0- Gift exchange\r\u00a0- Money\r\u00a0- Debt \r\u00a0- The Posthuman", "required_readings": "- Appadurai, A. 1987 (Ed.).
