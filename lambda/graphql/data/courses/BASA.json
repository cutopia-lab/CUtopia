The course covers selected advanced topics associated with the behavioral research process. In particular, students will learn how to apply various types of research design and statistical methods, and how to interpret the results. Sample topics include among others experimental design, measurement theory, cross-cultural research, significance tests and statistical power, interaction and moderating effects, multi-level analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modeling.
