The rapid rise of energy use after WWII has caused the degradation of our environment as well as adverse health effects in human populations. Furthermore, the steady rise of recent global average temperature and its correlation with the atmospheric CO2 concentration is particularly alarming. This course provides an overview of the present energy industry and their environmental impact. Fossil fuel is our main energy source today. Therefore, coal, petroleum and natural gas are emphasized. Their formation, exploration, reserve distribution, production, transport, refinement, final consumption, waste disposal and the carbon cycle are studied. The mechanical structure, configuration and efficiency of various fossil-fueled power plants and automobile engines are described. The life cycle assessment method is used to evaluate their requirement on water withdraw and consumption, carbon footprint and their relationship to global warming. Nuclear power plants provide approximately 20% of our electricity without producing greenhouse gases. Their operating principle, the biological effects of ionizing radiations, the radioactive waste problem, the nuclear weapon proliferation concerns, the risk of large scale accidents like Chernobyl (1986) and Fukushima (2011), and different nuclear policies adopted by various governments are discussed. These lead to the need of renewable energy sources for sustainable developments. The current status of solar, wind, biomass, hydropower, and geothermal energies are briefly presented as an introduction to the next course on renewable energy technologies.Note: Calculus is NOT a prerequisite.
