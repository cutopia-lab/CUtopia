Most importantly, students will also learn to be critical of their own research, and examine the complexity and difficulties of cultural research. While the course draws concepts from social sciences, it will also emphasize the importance of textual readings, and students will learn to be aware of the problems of quantitative research and statistical information.\r", "outcome": "1.Knowledge Outcomes\r\u00a0-Holistic approach to acquiring knowledge:\r\u00a0-Trans-disciplinary approach\r\u00a0-Historical and contemporary studies, including comparison and contrast\r\u00a0-Cross cultural contexts, including local, regional, and global\r\u00a0-Specialized and professional knowledge:\r\u00a0-Cultural approach to the study of contemporary living\r\u00a0-Cultural embedding of representation and the media\r\u00a0\u00a02.Skills Outcomes (Generic and Discipline/Professional)\r\u00a0-Textual and con-textual analysis\r\u00a0-Cultural appreciation and cultural criticism\r\u00a0-Critical and creative thinking\r\u00a0-Visual literacy\r\u00a0-Care for the wider community, concern for minority interests\r\u00a0\u00a03.Attitude Outcomes\r\u00a0-Aware of multicultural communities and respect for the other\r\u00a0-Being confident in expressing ones ideas\r\u00a0-Board-minded but strong in critical evaluation", "syllabus": "week 1: Course Introduction: Cultural Studies: An Ordinary Activity\r\u00a0\u00a0PART I SOME RESEARCH METHODS\r\u00a0week 2: Some Sociological Approaches to Culture\r\u00a0week 3: Cultural Studies: Engaging in Political Practice\r\u00a0week 4: The Uses of (Literary) Theory\r\u00a0week 5: Re-reading as a Form of Re-search\r\u00a0week 6: Between Cultural Theory & Practice\r\u00a0\u00a0PART II  DIALOGUES WITH SOME THINKERS\r\u00a0week 7: Derrida/Foucault Debate on Madness\r\u00a0week 8: Roland Barthes vs. Roland Barthes\r\u00a0week 9: Between Freud and Marx\r\u00a0week 10: The Influence of Walter Benjamin: On Distraction\r\u00a0\u00a0Part III SOME ISSUES BEHIND\r\u00a0week 11: Some Ethnographic Approaches\r\u00a0week 12: De-Eurocentricizing Cultural Studies\r\u00a0week 13: Ethics of Cultural Studies: Engaging with the Absolute Other", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": "Ien Ang, 'Who Needs Cultural Research?', Pepi Leistyna (ed.), Cultural Studies: From Theory to Action (Blackwell, 2005)\r\u00a0Janet Wolff, \u2018Cultural Studies and the Sociology of Culture\u2019, Contemporary Sociology, Vol. 28, No. 5 (Sep., 1999)\r\u00a0Steven Seidman, \u2018Relativizing Sociology: The Challenge of Cultural Studies\u2019, Elizabeth Long (ed.), From Sociology to Cultural Studies: New Perspective (Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell, 1997)\r\u00a0Gregor McLennan, \u2018Sociology and Cultural Studies: Rhetorics of Disciplinary Identity\u2019, History of the Human Sciences, Vol. 11, No.3: 1988\r\u00a0Ng Chun Hung, \u2018New Directions in Cultural Studies\u2019, Elizabeth Sinn ed., Culture and Society in Hong Kong (1995)\r\u00a0\u5442\u5927\u6a02\uff0c\u300a\u5514\u8a72\uff0c\u57cb\u55ae\uff01\uff1a\u4e00\u500b\u793e\u6703\u5b78\u5bb6\u7684\u9999\u6e2f\u7b46\u8a18\u300b(\u9999\u6e2f\uff1a\u9592\u4eba\u884c\uff0c1997)\r\u00a0Stuart Hall, \u2018The Emergence of Cultural Studies and the Crisis of the Humanities\u2019, October, Vol. 53, (Summer, 1990)\r\u00a0Lawrence Grossberg, Cary Nelson, and Paula A.

The course will also focus on the specificity of Hong Kong's experience in urban development and its adaptation of 'modernity' during a process of urbanization. The course will employ a wide range of visual images and audio-visual materials to explain the dynamism between modernity and urban culture.", "outcome": "\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To equip students with basic theories and concepts of urban studies, modernity, cultural geography, and critical theory.\u00a0\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To equip students with critical skills in analyzing the dynamism between modernity and urban culture in relation to examples from various visual and literary genres.\u00a0\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To enable students to use interdisciplinary critical perspectives to probe different dimensions in the phenomena of urban culture\u00a0\u009f\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To provide strategies to articulate cultural theories with our practices of everyday life\u00a0\u00a0", "syllabus": "Section 1: Modernitv and New Architecture\u00a01. \u00a0Urban Planning and the Development of Cities\u00a02. \u00a0Modernity and Modernism\u00a03. \u00a0Bauhaus and the New Architecture\u00a04. \u00a0New Utopia and its Failure\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 2: Tales of Cities\u00a05. \u00a0Modern Metropolis: Paris and London\u00a06. \u00a0Modem Metropolis: Chicago, New York and Los Angeles\u00a07. \u00a0Modem Metropolis: Shanghai\u00a08. \u00a0Hong Kong: A History of Urban development\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 3: Urban Culture and the Politics of Everyday\u00a09. \u00a0Metropolis and Sub-cultures\u00a010.

How do we get to understand issues of sustainability and environmental crisis from a broad historical perspective and global activism angle? How are gender, class and race interact with technology, damaged environment, animal and plant species? This course explores these questions and the rich debates in the emerging field of environmental humanity and literature of the Anthropocene.Class topics are organized on major global green movements that resisted oil pollution, toxic factories, logging companies, dam constructions and nuclear plant building. Students get to learn the historical developments of major environmental activism in the West and the global south. How was the Greenpeace founded? What is the Narmada Dam Movement in India? Do you know Ken Saro-Wiwa, an environmental activist against Shell oil pollution in Nigeria? In each class we examine historical texts, visual materials and theoretical debates to explore how environmental justice has been intertwined with histories of colonialism, neoliberalism, and questions of gender, race, poverty and class. Together the class explores the problem of the Anthropocene (Nature) in the context of colonial history, grass root struggles (Culture) and corporation greed (Power).This course addresses many of the 17 United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Climate Actions (13), Life on Land (15), Life below Water (14), Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions (16), Clean Energy (7), Reduced Inequalities (10), and Gender Inequality (5).

It will explore not just the work of a wide array of film directors, but also the texts and the condition of their production, distribution, exhibition and consumption within a transnational framework, all of which impinge on the question of \u201cnational\u201d film historiography. It will examine, in particular: the socio-political background of the emergence of the Taiwan New Cinema movement, its key directors and their works, the international context of their reception and the transnational nature of their production, and its legacy to date. It will provide students with an in-depth knowledge of the work of selected film authors and an awareness of the cinematic, cultural, and socio-political contexts in which they work, and enable students to analyse the work in relation to questions of transnationality and historiography.\r", "outcome": "On successful completion of this module, you should be able to:\r\u00a0\u00a0Module-specific skills:\r\u00a0\u00a0a.Demonstrate an advanced appreciation of the historical development of the Taiwan New Cinema movement, and its key directors and films.\r\u00a0b.Demonstrate an informed appreciation of how concepts of film authorship can be related to modes of production, modes of funding, and an international context of cinephilia. \r\u00a0c.Demonstrate an advanced critical understanding of key debates on the various aspects of transnational cinemas, from production and distribution to the analysis of texts and authors. \r\u00a0d.Demonstrate an advanced critical capacity to interrogate the notion of \u201cnational cinema\u201d and the way in which it has been challenged in film historiography. \r\u00a0\u00a0Discipline-specific skills:\r\u00a0\u00a0a.Demonstrate an advanced capacity to analyse films from different periods in the Taiwan New Cinema movement and to relate their concerns and modes of expression to their historical contexts. \r\u00a0b.Demonstrate advanced analytical skills in the close formal, thematic, generic and authorial analysis of different kinds of films. \r\u00a0c.Demonstrate advanced intellectual and critical skills in the research and evaluation of relevant material for the study of film and communicate these conclusions effectively and fluently using appropriate critical and technical language. \r\u00a0d.Demonstrate an advanced capacity to consider the relationship between film and its complex production conditions and to relate film history to a wider context beyond the national.\r\u00a0\u00a0Personal and key skills:\r\u00a0\u00a0a.Undertake independent research on the basis of a taught course. \r\u00a0b.Adopt a critical approach to the selection and organisation of a large body of material in order to produce, to a deadline, a written, oral or visually sustained argument of some complexity.\r\u00a0c.Present a cogent and sustained argument orally / in writing, in English, on an aspect of the subject of the student\u2019s own choosing, and selecting appropriate methods of exposition.\r\u00a0d.Using bibliographical material provided, select, plan and carry out a programme of study leading to an essay / presentation on a chosen topic, to a specified length and deadline.\r\u00a0e.Demonstrate ability to combine a variety of IT skills in researching and reporting on a topic.", "syllabus": "SYLLABUS PLAN\r\u00a0\u00a0Week 1 Taiwan Cinema Before \u201cTaiwan New Cinema\u201d\r\u00a0Week 2 The \u201cTaiwan New Cinema\u201d Movement\r\u00a0Week 3  Authorship (I): Hou Hsiao-hsien \r\u00a0Week 4  Authorship (II): Edward Yang\r\u00a0Week 5 No classes \u2013 Lunar New Year holidays\r\u00a0Week 6 Authorship (III): Ang Lee \r\u00a0Week 7  Authorship (IV): Tsai Ming-liang\r\u00a0Week 8 Transnationality (I): France\r\u00a0Week 9 Transnationality (II): USA\r\u00a0Week 10 Transnationality (III): Southeast Asia\r\u00a0Week 11  Historiography (I): Sinophone Cinema \r\u00a0Week 12  Historiography (II): Post-Taiwan New Cinema\r\u00a0Week 13 Essay writing workshop and consultation\r\u00a0Week 14 Essay writing workshop and consultation", "required_readings": "WEEK 1 \r\u00a0TAIWAN CINEMA BEFORE \u201cTAIWAN NEW CINEMA\u201d\r\u00a0\u00a0Required viewing:\r\u00a0A Touch of Zen (King Hu, 1971) \u4fe0\u5973\uff08\u80e1\u91d1\u9293\uff09\r\u00a0\u00a0Required reading:\r\u00a0*Taiwan Film Directors, \u201cIntroduction: Treasure Island\u201d, and Chapter 1, \u201cParallel \r\u00a0Cinemas: Postwar History and Major Directors\u201d.\r\u00a0Hong, Guo-Juin (2010) \u201cHistoriography of Absence: Taiwan Cinema Before New Cinema \r\u00a0 1982\u201d, Journal of Chinese Cinemas 4 (1): 5-14. \r\u00a0\u00a0Further reading:\r\u00a0Berry, Chris (2009) \u201cRe-writing Cinema: Markets, Languages, Cultures in Taiwan\u201d, in \r\u00a0Fang-long Shih, Stuart Thompson and Paul-Fran\u00e7ois Tremlett (eds.), Re-writing Culture in Taiwan, Abington, Oxon: Routledge, pp. 140-153.\r\u00a0Bordwell, David (2000) \u201cRichness through Imperfection: King Hu and the Glimpse\u201d, in \r\u00a0 Poshek Fu and David Desser (eds.), The Cinema of Hong Kong: History, Arts, \r\u00a0 Identity, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 113-136.\r\u00a0Farquhar, Mary (2003) \u201cA Touch of Zen: Action in Martial Arts Movies\u201d, in Chris Berry \r\u00a0 (ed.), Chinese Films in Focus: 25 New Takes, London: BFI Publishing, 167-174. \r\u00a0Horng, Menghsin C.

We believe that a careful reading of these transnational flows would help us reconsider what Hong Kong culture and Chinese culture mean in contemporary bodies and indentity.

The aim of this course is to provide the students with a knowledge of and insight into the key concepts, the historical development, and the socio-cultural implications of performance both in international scene and local context. Not only do we study the archives, the manifestations, the theory and the practice of various performers, composers, choreographers, actors, art and stage directors from different periods and traditions, but we also focus on the interpretation and communication, the audience reception and spectatorship of the social mass. It is a course draws on a wide variety of disciplines including social sciences, semiotics, speech-act theory, psychoanalysis, gender and queer studies, with which we can investigate the stylistic features, the quality of theatricality, the technical change, the hybridity and the boundary-crossing of performance in our era.", "outcome": "On successful completion of the course, you will be able to:\u00a01.Understand the diversity and similarities of different Asian cultures from a cultural studies perspective\u00a02.Understand the unique position of Asia in the current globalization discourse\u00a03.

Nowadays comic strip has become one of the major forms of visual narratives in our culture. Both comics and film are visual arts originally developed within the period of late 19th century and early 20th century. Although film has long ago established its artistic legitimacy, comic art still struggle for recognition. However, as Will Eisner put it, comic strip is a \u201cSequential Art\u201d and has its own unique aesthetic nature. This course tries to inquire the governing aesthetic principles of comics and investigate its unique method of expression. We will also try to delineate the special communication mode of comics and its relationship with different aspects of modern society and culture. Students will learn to appreciate comic art from different perspectives, and strengthen analytical skills for visual media.\r", "outcome": "1. Through the lectures, students will recognize the aesthetic nature of sequential art and locate the humanistic values and meanings of comic arts for modern society and culture.2.

Through mid-term assignment (research portfolio on the visual representation of comics), student will distinguish, compare, analyze and criticize different visual and multimedia sources.\u00a04. Through final paper, student will prepare and manage to do an academic research on visual representation.\u00a05.

The belief system, indigenous custom, human diasporas as well as community cohesiveness of the Chinese can be illustrated from both temples and festivals in China and Hong Kong.\r", "outcome": "\u00a0 \u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u8a8d\u8b58\u5edf\u5b87\u3001\u7bc0\u8a95\u8207\u6c11\u9593\u6587\u5316\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u901a\u904e\u5edf\u5b87\u3001\u7bc0\u8a95\u5be6\u4f8b\uff0c\u4f7f\u540c\u5b78\u4e86\u89e3\u9999\u4e2d\u570b\u53ca\u6e2f\u6b77\u53f2\u8207\u793e\u6703\u8b8a\u9077\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u5edf\u5b87\u3001\u7bc0\u8a95\u5982\u4f55\u53cd\u6620\u9999\u6e2f\u6587\u7269\u4fdd\u80b2\u8207\u6587\u5316\u907a\u7522\u4fdd\u5b58\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u5f9e\u5edf\u5b87\u770b\u50b3\u7d71\u5efa\u7bc9\u8207\u85dd\u8853\u96d5\u98fe\u7684\u7279\u8272\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0", "syllabus": "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u9999\u6e2f\u5edf\u5b87\u4ecb\u7d39\uff1a\u6b77\u53f2\u3001\u5206\u985e\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u00a0 \u00a0 \u4e2d\u570b\u5730\u65b9\u5edf\u5b87\u7684\u784f\u7a76\u8ab2\u984c\uff081):\u795e\u9748\u4fe1\u4ef0\u3001\u796d\u7940\u3001\u795e\u8a95\u548c\u7bc0\u6176\u00a0 \u00a0 \u4e2d\u570b\u5730\u65b9\u5edf\u5b87\u7684\u784f\u7a76\u8ab2\u984c(2):\u5b97\u65cf\u3001\u570b\u5bb6\u548c\u5730\u65b9\u793e\u6703\u00a0 \u00a0 \u4e2d\u570b\u5730\u65b9\u5edf\u7684\u784f\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6b77\u53f2\u6587\u737b\u3001\u7891\u523b\u3001\u5100\u5f0f\u3001\u7530\u91ce\u8003\u5bdf\u00a0 \u00a0 \u9999\u6e2f\u5edf\u5b87\u784f\u7a76--\u500b\u6848\u5206\u6790\uff081): \u5929\u540e\u5edf\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u9999\u6e2f\u5edf\u5b87\u784f\u7a76--\u500b\u6848\u5206\u6790\uff082): \u6587\u6b66\u5edf\u3001\u5317\u5e1d\u5edf\u00a0 \u00a0 \u6e2f\u5edf\u5b87\u784f\u7a76\u500b-- \u4e3b\u984c\u5206\u6790\uff081):\u5730\u65b9\u5edf\u5b87\u8207\u795e\u8a95\u7bc0\u6176\u53ca\u6253\u91ae\u00a0 \u00a0 \u6e2f\u5edf\u5b87\u784f\u7a76\u500b-- \u4e3b\u984c\u5206\u6790\uff082):\u5730\u65b9\u5edf\u5b87\u8207\u9999\u6e2f\u793e\u6703\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u8b8a\u9077\u00a0 \u00a0 \u6e2f\u5edf\u5b87\u784f\u7a76\u500b-- \u4e3b\u984c\u5206\u6790\uff083):\u5730\u65b9\u5edf\u5b87\u8207\u5b97\u65cf\u53ca\u6751\u843d\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u00a0 \u00a0 \u9999\u6e2f\u5edf\u5b87\u7684\u795e\u9748\u4fe1\u4ef0\u53ca\u50b3\u7d71\uff1a(1):\u5929\u540e\u5143\u541b\u3001\u95dc\u8056\u5e1d\u541b\u00a0 \u00a0 \u9999\u6e2f\u5edf\u5b87\u7684\u795e\u9748\u4fe1\u4ef0\u53ca\u50b3\u7d71\uff1a(2):\u5317\u5e1d\uff08\u771f\u6b66\u3001\u7384\u5929\u4e0a\u5e1d\uff09\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0", "required_readings": "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u9127\u6d77\u8d85\u7b49\u300a\u9999\u6e2f\u5cf6\u5340\u4e4b\u83ef\u4eba\u5edf\u5b87\u300b\uff0c\u9999\u6e2f\u5927\u5b78\u4e9e\u6d32\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c1983\u3002\u00a02.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u9673\u614e\u6176\u7de8\u300a\u8af8\u795e\u5609\u5e74\u83ef\uff1a\u9999\u6e2f\u5b97\u6559\u7814\u7a76\u300b\uff0cHong Kong: Oxford University Press, 2002.\u00a03.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jean Law & Barbara E.

How do we understand and connect to animal kingdom?How do human-animal connections shape modern culture and society?How do cultural studies and humanities expand our scope on animal and nature?Culture is ordinary, in Raymond William\u2019s saying, but the ordinariness is merely treated as a reflection of human everyday life. Although cultural studies has sustained concern on everyday life with mass production, consumerism, sexism, racism and postmodernism, the discipline always lags behind the concern of nature and animal species. As the issues of animal abuse, environmental protection, factory farming, animal protection policy and law-making, as well as media various portrayals being the hot topics of our (post)modern world, the study of animal with the perspective of cultural studies and other humanity disciplines can explore the possibilities of better human-animal relationship. This course is designed with an empathic concern of other-than-human animals. By exploring different issues of human and animals\u2019 life, this course looks for a harmonious balance of nature and modern culture.This course focuses on three areas, through which we can explore the different aspects of animal and cultural studies. These areas are:A. Entering Jurassic Park \u2013 Remaking Animals in Leisure (Lecture A1-A4)B. Attacking Godzilla \u2013 Representing Animals in Media (Lecture B1-B4)C. Finding Nemo \u2013 Revitalizing Animals in the City  (Lecture C1-C4)Each area covers a set of animal issue discussion. Area A, apart from theorizing animal with cultural studies, tackles the basic animal issues: pet-nurturing, zoo-building, forest-sustaining and tourism. This is to provide a foundation for understanding animals with a critical reflection of everyday life. Area B, set with the concern of media, discusses issues of animal representation in cartoon, cinema, literature and journalism. This is to read how animals would be represented and how this affects human understanding and related policy-making. A screening will be run after Lecture Area B. This is to provide an alternative understanding of animal representation in popular media. Area C further deals with the matters of animal-city relationship in seeing how dogs and cats, cattle and swine, and fishes and dolphins are (mal)treated in the street, the farm and the sea respectively. This is to end the course with a leading thought of perfect balance of nature and modernity; and more queries of human-animal relationship will be raised for contemplation.", "outcome": " Learning Outcomes: On successful completion of the course, students are expected to be able to:  Explain the concern of other-than-human animal with cultural studies perspective;  Identify the key issues and critical assessment of human-animal relationship;  Understand the approach in studying culture, animal and environment;  Enrich the angle of analyzing human living and animal species.", "syllabus": " Area A\u00a0 Entering Jurassic Park \u2013 Remaking Animals in Leisure Week 1.

Students are required to read 10 to 20 pages of selected theoretical writings before the class, and during the class time teachers will go over the writings and engage in meaningful discussions with students together. Each of the students is expected to participate in the discussion actively. Focus will be placed not only on understanding the main ideas but also on the organization, arguments, and rhetoric style of the specific writing. Intense reading continues in the remaining seven weeks, but in a reduced amount. The main task of the second part will be academic writing, and each student will have to produce an academic paper (about 15 pages) on their own, with the close supervision of the teacher. The teacher will go through the drafts of the paper with the student to understand the various aspects of essay writing such as the planning process, structuring an argument, organization, and summarizing. Students are also required to share their questions and problems encountered together, and there will be peer comments on each other\u2019s drafts. Students will also be reminded of avoiding plagiarism as well as the appropriate academic style. The aim is to give students an understanding of the principles of academic writing rather than just a superficial knowledge of the procedures. In order to ensure teaching quality, a quota of 16 students will be imposed.

How has the rise of modern state power shaped and reshaped Muslims\u2019 understanding of their tradition? What forms of lives, histories and struggles can and cannot be captured by this problematic? We will then spend the last several weeks exploring case studies that are considered to be paradigmatic of Islamic politics today. We will look at such historical and contemporary controversies as the Iraq War, the Arab Spring, the rise of ISIS, and the Jamal Khashoggi affair.

While Confucian, Buddhist and Daoist thoughts permeate classical Chinese novels, a large number of modern Chinese novels are peppered with Christian elements. As a lively epitome of Chinese religious culture, these novels also promoted the spread of religious thoughts among the people. This course aims to investigate the interactive relationship between Chinese novels and religion. Students will be guided to examine the religious contents in novels and the ways in which religious thoughts shape the themes, narratives, characterization and language of the novels.

The aim of the course is to show that pornography is a not a unified screen culture but consists of varied representations within cultural contexts. The course will teach students how to analyze these representations and how to take into account their cultural histories. The course will take a Cultural Studies approach and examine within specific cultural environments and include the positions of anti-porn and pro-porn activists. Therefore students will get an overview of diverging perspectives while being encouraged to consider their own values and critical responses. Students will be asked to respond to theories and audio-visual examples, while actively partaking in debates about pornography and its impact on religion, gender, sexuality, health, labor and economy. Finally, the course will pay special importance to how contemporary sexually explicit media are impacting new user groups such young adult netizens, female consumers, disabled people, as well as ethnic and sexual minorities. Students will carry out a major assignment while learning how to apply ethnographic research methods to analyze representations of the body and sexuality within screen cultures. In this assignment, they will focus on a media environment/platform and a sexual culture of their choice to find out how culture is being redefined and visualized by media users. Two workshops will be organized in the media lab in order to train the students in different methods and perspectives on digital ethnographyLanguage of instruction: Classes and assignments will be carried out in the English language and students\u2019 active participation in both lectures and tutorials will be required. Students can carry out ethnographic fieldwork in Cantonese or any language of your choice, but need to present the results in English.Learning Activities: Students are required to attend a 3-hour class each week. The course combines theoretical lectures with the viewing of films and media examples. There will also be tutorial sessions each week based on the lectures and on the weekly readings. All students are required to post weekly reflections on Blackboard and to participate in discussions. In addition to the weekly readings and reflections, students will conduct research and planning for their assessments and oral presentations independently and in groups.Please be advised that this course will involve some screenings and discussions of sexually explicit materials and category III films.

The urge to re-align culture with planning is a result of experience and experiments in European and North American cities in recent decades, beginning in the arena of conservation and urban regeneration and coincided with the rise of the cultural and creative economy.

The course will be based in the computer lab with workshops held every week covering the fundamentals of 3D modeling; sculpting meshes, texturing, lighting, rigging and rendering animations as well as creative design principles of 3D animation. The course takes the definition of the 'postdigital' as a description of our contemporary relation to the internet and technology from the post-2000's when it is no longer perceived as 'new' but integrated into the fabric of our daily lives. It will examine how postdigital animation has been integrated into multiple interfaces (smartphones, laptops, pads), media (film, video, digital) and platforms (theatres, exhibitions) and focus specifically on the Asian context, looking at the works of various artists working with animation and how they have moved beyond translating traditional media into new media through 'remediation' (Manovich: 2014), to create entirely new aesthetic vocabularies in virtual spaces. Students will be expected to create a short 3D animated film as the final assessment which demonstrates a thorough understanding of 3D modeling techniques and the digital animation production process taught over the course of the semester. Additionally, the students will be expected to critically evaluate and understand how contemporary Asian artists are using 3D animation as a part of their practice to creatively express their responses to Asian society, culture and history. Students will critically engage with readings each week which will ultimately give them a through understanding of key issues relevant to contemporary animation in academia and in pop culture. The ultimate outcome for the course is that students are able to use the tools and skills involved in 3D animation to become artists themselves or integrate it into their professional roles as filmmakers, designers, curators or art administration professionals.", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "4121", "title": "Chan School of Buddhism", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "LectureInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Dept of Cultural & Rel Studies", "requirements": "", "description": "The Chan movement has been described by Hu Shih as a reformation or revolution in Buddhism and by Suzuki as a movement in which the Chinese mind completely asserted itself, in a sense, in opposition to the Indian mind.
