Theatre explicates the psychology of human thinking and behaviors on stage and psychology processes underlie how artists enact their performance and how audience receives these performances. This is a general education course that introduces fundamental psychology concepts in the context of theatre. Students will learn emotions, cognitions and social processes of psychology and how they are integrated in the making of and experience of theatre. This course enables students to appreciate and analyze theatre from a psychological perspective. More importantly, this course allows students to understand oneself through psychology and theatre.While the title of the course is \u201cPsychology of Theatre\u201d, \u201ctheatre\u201d is broadly defined to go beyond drama to cover related performing arts like dance, music, opera and alike. All these art forms share common elements of using the human body as an expression of thoughts and emotions via text, songs, movements and/or instruments in the theatre. The focus and majority of the illustrations are still about theatre as in drama. Coverage including related art forms is intentional because the same psychological elements are applicable to these different art forms. For example, the function of theatre as emotional expression applies to music, opera, dance and drama. Stage fright affects actors/actresses and also musicians and opera singers. The use of body as non-verbal expressions is essential to drama and dance. Psychosocial and interpersonal conflicts as depicted in stories are common to both drama and opera.\r", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "1552", "title": "Chinese Chan and Living", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "LectureInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Office of University GE", "requirements": "Not for Psychology Majors. ;Co-requisite: UGFH1000, UGFN1000 or UGFN1001 (only applicable to students admitted to the 4-year curriculum)", "description": "Chinese \"Chan\" has its own unique characteristics after adopting the Chinese culture and history for over thousands of years although it originated from the Indian Buddhism.

This Course is designed to provide students with the latest scientific knowledge on the development of positive psychology as well as its applications. Students will not only learn practical behavioural, cognitive and social skills that enhance their positive emotions and thus resilience and strength, they will also learn to identify and leverage their own virtues and strengths in their daily life.

particular the grass roots through generations, though it might be considered as trivia or heresy when compared to the dominant Confucian thoughts. Legends in the Tang dynasty, gongan stories in Song and Ming, xiayi novels in Qing, and the contemporary wuxia novels are all literary manifestations of this spirit. This course attempts to explore the spiritual profile of Chinese people and to analyse the characteristics of Chinese culture through the appreciation of this unique Chinese novel genre. Students will also be guided to learn more about traditional Chinese culture and the development of Chinese literature.\r", "outcome": "

This course aims to provide a historical and cultural overview of the genre of superheroes and the Marvel empire.

The visual artistry and matching of illustrations with text and plot produced a uniquely new form of weekly reading material. The development of the DC and Marvel superheroes of the 80s and 90s built on Asian illustrated traditions and forged new relationships between East and West comics and graphics styles. Today, the genre is among the most dominant cultural forms worldwide. This course will introduce you to the comics and graphic novel literary genre and their movie spin-offs. The course will also have a workshop element and seek graphic and illustrated responses from students. Above all, the course will investigate the role of the superhero. Who is this superhero, or rather what is a superhero? Why does the fantasy of an individual with supernatural powers generate such fascination in modern society? These are some of the questions we will explore during this course. The genre\u2019s transformations over the last nine decades reflect both political, cultural, and social changes.

Environmental writing is also political engagement (biopolitics, as it were) as the ultimate aim of environmental writing is to effect policy change to protect, nurture, and sustain the environment and humankind. In this course, we will explore how to use different modes and genres of writing to effect environmental change. We will first examine the major elements of environmental writing through the exploration of different modes and genres, including children\u2019s books, blogs, essays, poetry, songs, social media, Apps, newspaper articles, and posters. We will then examine the major environmental issues we are facing globally and in Hong Kong, and examine how environmental writing is currently being used in Hong Kong to engage the public and effect change. We will also investigate public awareness of the major environmental issues facing Hong Kong, to develop an understanding of how we can engage the public more effectively through writing. Finally, we will engage in our own environmental writing by creating three pieces of environmental writing, each examining the same environmental issue through a different type of writing. Key questions this course explores:\u2022 How can we use writing to raise awareness of environmental issues and effect environmental change?\u2022 What are the most pressing local and global environmental issues we face today? How is environmental writing currently being used in Hong Kong to engage the public and the government to respond to these issues?

The course will begin from the basic by introducing the mainstream material productions from ancient to modern China: jades, antique bronzes, lacquer, ceramics, architecture, silk, as well as grave goods. The discussions instruct students to appreciate these essential elements of Chinese culture from the perspectives of their physical qualities, craftsmanship, and historical values. They are also to encourage students to think about the roles of material objects in shaping cultural, ethnic, and even national identities.", "outcome": "Upon completion of the course, students would be able to identify the material and artistic features of some mainstream Chinese artifacts; develop interests in Chinese culture from the perspective of objects; identify key historical sites and remains of pre-modern China; develop acute senses for appreciating traditions and values; develop interests in culture and history; analyze the sources of Chinese heritage and traditions; think critically about historical and other relevant cultural presentations; and get prepared for further trainings in the disciplines of art history, archaeology, anthropology and history.", "syllabus": "1. Introduction: What is the present view about Chinese material culture? \u00a0Present-day China received huge inheritance from the many groups of people and cultural traditions that existed in antiquity. This session introduce a range of material culture that makes up the broad family of Chinese culture. The most important types include jades, antique bronzes, lacquer, ceramics, and architecture. The definitions given here hope to broaden the scope and include the less-discussed categories of clothing and costumes, sculpture, and grave goods. This overview leads students to consider the many sources of traditional values now embodied in the material culture that we now describe as \u2018Chinese\u2019.\u00a0\u00a02. Jades\u00a0In China, jades have always been understood to have spiritual power and artistic values. What is the scientific definition of jades? How did Confucius and his contemporaries define the roles of jades? How did their teachings shape the understanding of jades in Chinese society? And what are the present views about jades? This session will respond to this question by giving a review of jade history, usage and craftsmanship.\u00a0\u00a03. Antique bronzes\u00a0Among the many treasures inherited from the past, bronzes are core collections that they are always found as representatives of ancient China in modern museums both in China and overseas. This session will describe different categories of bronzes and the motifs found on them in relation to their dates. It will also introduce the imperial collections found in the Kaogu tu, and later on in Xiqing gujian; and explain the values and significance of bronze collections in modern museums. \u00a0\u00a04. Lacquer\u00a0Lacquer is a unique production of ancient China. This session introduces the complicated steps involved in its production, and reviews lacquer-using history in China and in other parts of Asia. The discussion leads student to become aware of the broad transmission of the lacquer-using traditions in Asia that shaped a central role for China in antiquity.\u00a0\u00a05. Sculpture\u00a0In China, sculptural representation is closely tied with religious practices. This session will introduce the Buddhist sites in Henan and Sichuan, as well as the pictorial representations found in the Daoist temples in Hebei. The session will describe the renewed definition of sculpture in the modern times when the Western artistic values were received.\u00a0\u00a06. Architecture\u00a0Architecture forms an essential part of material culture. In China, however, the studies of historical architecture began rather late. This session introduces the classic writings by Liang Sicheng, as well as the renowned Yingcao fasi, the Building Manual composed in the Song period, which founded the standardized Chinese construction works. \u00a0\u00a07. Silk\u00a0Silk production began in the late Neolithic period. This session introduces the traditional steps in silk-making and weaving as found in craftsman handbooks published in the Ming period; and discusses how silk as commodity embodies the rich history of cultural exchange between China and the West through trade.\u00a0\u00a08. Ceramics\u00a0Ceramics are representative productions of south China. This session introduces the production of the classic kilns of Ge, Yu, Ding, Longquan, and Jingdezhen. This session instructs students to identify the colour, texture, decoration, as well as motifs found on the ceramics produced in different areas. They embody rich aesthetic values deemed appropriate in Confucian classics.\u00a0\u00a09. Ornaments\u00a0Chinese ornaments comprise an extended family of motifs that include flowers, birds, figures, beasts, characters, as well as scenes. This session discuss two key groups: plants and dragons. The former was adopted from both nature and religious practices; whereas the latter was acquired through cultural construction over time. This session discusses how the two genres merged along difference courses into what we understand as being Chinese today. \u00a0\u00a010. Chinese calligraphy and paintings\u00a0Chinese calligraphy and paintings represent a major aesthetic system that includes the use of ink and brush, writing, as well as imagination particularly defined in Daoist writings. This session introduces the basic concepts of calligraphy and the features found in the classic paintings from the Song to the Qing periods. \u00a0\u00a011. Grave goods: objects for the deceased \u00a0Mingqi is a unique category of items produced in China. It is a group of goods created especially for the burial with the deceased that they are closely connected with the Chinese ideas about ghosts, spirits, and afterlife. This session will review the history of mingqi from as early as the Bronze Age, and look into how this understanding is translated in modern practice.\u00a0\u00a012. Antique collection and modern consumerism\u00a0The antiquities of China provide a resourceful base for modern designers and cultural industries. In light of modern consuming practices, Chinese designers, architects, museum workers, historians, and other culture-related professionals fall back on inheritance to seek for ideas to create something new and unique for the country. This session reviews the concerns of relevant practitioners. \u00a0\u00a013. Conclusion \u00a0The concluding session outline the present ideas about material culture and its role in modern society, which is a topic that has become increasingly important in the spheres of anthropology and sociology. This session will combine the discussions on Chinese material culture and the discourse of object studies. This will give students ideas to develop interests in the study of China; and enable them to engage the past with the present.", "required_readings": "Primary textbooks\u00a0i. Dant, Tim.

Do these thoughts and emotions support the real purpose of our life, bringing fulfillment and happiness? Or do they make our life an endless cycle of stress, anger, fear, and even hopelessness? The course offers an orientation into mindfulness meditation as a possible way of \u201cresetting,\u201d at personal and inter-personal levels. Emphasis is on reflective participation, supplemented by knowledge of basic concepts and principles.From the formal practice of sitting cross-legged and quietly counting the breaths to the informal practice of embracing each moment in daily life, students will be guided to cultivate samma sati, or \u201cright mindfulness,\u201d one of the Eightfold Paths to end suffering. Mindfulness meditation (MM) is grounded in ancient Buddhist sutras named Anapanasati (\u201cmindfulness breathing\u201d) and Satipatthana (\u201cfoundation of mindfulness\u201d) and 2,500 years of lay and monastic practice. It aims for the practitioner to develop one-pointed concentration on the body, feelings, mind, and dharmas (phenomena), and thereby to reflect on their impermanence, comprehend no-self, and cultivate loving kindness. Over the past decades, a whole range of secular mindfulness practices, or mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), have emerged to serve therapeutic and educational purposes. Students may also explore one or more of such modern applications, and ponder the contribution of mindfulness training to good health and well-being (Sustainable Development Goal 3), and to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) as a whole.The course will take students on a one-week retreat in a Buddhist meditation centre, preceded by readings and presentations on relevant topics, and followed by a personal reflection and a mini-research on the experience. Through undisturbed practice of mindfulness meditation away from home and along with peers and monastics, students will master the basic skills of the formal practice and begin to develop a habit of mindful living.

This course seeks to explore the material basis of the Nature artistically heightened by the ancient artists directed by their \u201cheart-source\u201d. We would try to explore the abstract philosophical ideas and aesthetic ideals by looking at something physical and concrete: by visiting specific scenic sites, we would be able to compare the landscape with the paintings they inspired and have more idea on how the visual vocabulary and grammar of Chinese painting \u201ctranslates\u201d the real world; and by viewing the objects, or even experience some of the activities central to the artists\u2019 cultural life, students would also have a more substantial understanding on the \u201cheart-source\u201d of these painters.This course would use the Songjiang and Wu Schools of painting as case studies. A field trip will be organized and students will be walked through the areas of Shanghai, Suzhou and Hangzhou where the Ming Dynasty painters were active in.

Although film has long ago established its artistic legitimacy, comic art still struggle for recognition. However, as Will Eisner put it, comic strip is a \u201cSequential Art\u201d and has its own unique aesthetic nature. This course tries to inquire the governing aesthetic principles of comics and investigate its unique method of expression.

The first part equips students with specific film languages for film appreciation. The discussion of avant-garde movies and genre draws students\u2019 attention to the dynamics as well as the competition between the two major modes of cultural productions. The last part introduces a variety of critical theories that will lead the understanding of movies to the rethinking of significant issues of human concerns. Key concepts will be introduced so that students can apply them in formulating their film analysis. The sequence of these issues implies a progression of knowledge from film specific to interdisciplinary approach and from film appreciation to critical evaluation. \u00a0 The following is an outline of the course: \u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Introduction: Film Styles: Realism and Formalism This lecture will introduce the two major styles of films: realism and formalism.

This course introduces students to the study of morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective. Morality and ethics became a distinct area for anthropological inquiry as recently as the beginning of the 21st century. Why this topic is relatively new in anthropology has something to do with the way in which moral differences have been conflated with cultural differences in the history of the discipline. In other words, anthropologists have long presumed that differences between right and wrong, good and bad, are culturally constructed. In recent years, however, this conflation has been questioned and problematized, with reference to the problem of competing moral goods within a single society and the role of the individual in negotiating moral commitments. Having much to say about cultural differences as well as contingent social processes, anthropologists are now in an even better position to contribute to cross-disciplinary conversations about the nature of morality and ethics. By exploring morality and ethics from a social and cross-cultural perspective, this course will demonstrate that morality and ethics is by no means an abstract subject best studied by philosophers. Students will be encouraged to see ethics as a part of their everyday lives, and to see the lives of others as shaped by shared human problems such as how to get along with other people, and how to get along with oneself. This course is divided into four major units. It begins with an issue highly relevant to university students: the responsibility individuals carry for their own success and self-fulfillment in capitalist societies. The second unit considers why moral and cultural differences have been conflated, and how different societies have responded to shared human problems in different ways. The third unit explores the relationship between morality and the creation and maintenance of social relationships. Case studies of small communities in different parts of the world will be especially helpful for understanding morality and ethics from a social perspective, as cooperation can be fragile yet so important in small communities. Topics and readings in the last unit offer resources for enriching and expanding our vocabulary of virtues. Students will be invited to conduct research into the mundane things ordinary people do to take care of one another in daily life.\r", "outcome": "\u00a0 1.

Mental illness is often considered as an adversary that should be dealt with by medical professionals. Challenging this monopolized medical discourse on mental illness, this course aims to expand the students\u2019 view to appreciate how mental illness has been psychologically influenced, socially constructed and policed, as well as culturally shaped. Coupling biochemistry\u2019s knowledge of mental illness with self-reflections, students are expected to develop a critical and comprehensive understanding of mental illness and mental health. With the use of experiential exercises, case studies, and film viewing, students will be further encouraged to scrutinize mental health issues in their daily lives. As there is a growing number of individuals challenged by mental illnesses both locally and internationally, students will have high chance of encountering an individual with mental illnesses in their social circles, workplaces or even family in the future. The development of a comprehensive and critical view towards mental illnesses will definitely prepare them to face this future challenge.[All students will be required to plan and organize a compulsory experiential learning activity for service users at a mental health agency/setting during Reading Week. The experiential activity is compulsory and if interested students foresee that they cannot commit to this, they should not be enrolling in this course.]\r", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "2778", "title": "Service Leadership", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Cross Institutional Project", "components": "Lecture", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Office of University GE", "requirements": "Not for students who have taken GESC2430.;Co-requisite: UGFH1000, UGFN1000 or UGFN1001 (only applicable to students admitted to the 4-year curriculum)", "description": "The University of Hong Kong (HKU), The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) are partners in a joint project entitled \u201cThe Responsive Universities: Appreciating Content Sharing in General Education\u201d, which is funded by the UGC Funding Scheme for Teaching and Learning Related Proposals in the 2016-19 Triennium.

Increasingly uneven and intensified processes of urbanization simultaneously generate serious challenges and exciting opportunities for urban populations across the globe. Contemporary cities are as much spaces of resonance, innovation, and emancipation as sites of violence, pollution, and alienation. This course revolves around the distinctive rhythms, experiences, and dynamics of urban life. What gives urban living its distinct characteristics? What current social, economic, and political problems deserve the attention of urban inhabitants? Which issues generate the greatest discord and motivate full coordination among different actors involved in governing cities? As urban life is characterized by both cosmopolitan conviviality and immense inequality, in this course students will learn about different modes of coexistence and exclusion in contemporary cities. Globalizing forms of urban protest arising from struggles over urban resources, space, and decision-making mechanisms will be investigated. By highlighting the complex and contested dynamics of urban life, the course will help students situate and interpret their everyday urban experiences at the intersection of multiple and interconnected flows, networks, and scales that are produced by the city and that produce it.", "outcome": " After taking this course, students will be able to:  Comprehend general debates, themes, and concepts in critical urban theory,  Apply key concepts and theories reflexively to their own experiences in the city,  Gain a critical understanding of urban politics, social movements, and public space,  Use qualitative methods as a tool for interpreting the struggles over urban governance, contested claims to urban space, and symbolic construction of city as text.", "syllabus": " The following topics are included in the course:\u00a0 PART I: EXPERIENCING THE CITY Topic 1: Town and Countryside Topic 2: Modernity and Urbanization Topic 3: City Culture(s) Topic 4: Narrating the City Topic 5: Urban Experiences \u00a0 PART II: GOVERNING THE CITY Topic 6: Cities and Democracy Topic 7: Living with Others Topic 8: The Multicultural City Topic 9: Changing Actors of Urban Governance \u00a0 PART III: (RE)CLAIMING THE CITY Topic 10: Divided Lives, Security, Inequality Topic 11: Right to the City Topic 12: Globalization of Urban Protest Topic 13: Glocalization of Urban Protest", "required_readings": " Topic 1: Pile, S. 1999.

Sociology helps us understand human behaviors by examining the social settings in which people live their lives. The primary goal of this course is to help you think sociologically \u2014 to think about the social factors that shape people\u2019s actions and beliefs \u2014 and to show you how such thinking is useful. Through systematic examination, we will try to use sociology to make sense of people\u2019s behavior and ideas.The course is organized into three parts.\u2022 First, we start with the question: Why do people do what they do? We develop the basic building blocks or tools of a sociological perspective to begin to answer this question. Sociology is fundamentally about patterns (we will sometimes call them \u201cstructures\u201d) of social relations and interaction and how these patterns influence what people do and think. We introduce ideas and concepts that help analyze and explain how behavioral patterns differ from person to person, from culture to culture, from one time to another.\u2022 Second, we ask the question: Who gets what? And why? Here we look at structures of inequality and try to make sense of uneven distributions of valued resources among individuals, groups, and societies. We investigate the social mechanisms that maintain or change those inequalities. \u2022 Third, we ask the questions: Why do things change? And why do they sometimes stay the same? Our focus here is on the great social institutions common to, yet different in, all societies, starting with family and marriage and moving from there to religion, politics, and criminal justice. We also examine sources of social change that shape and challenge inequalities and institutions.In short, this course involves the study of:\u2022 interpersonal, and social-cultural factors associated with individual behavior, collective action, or societal development.\u2022 human collectivities, organization, institutions, and cultures, their infrastructures and interrelationships.\u2022 capacities for and/or techniques of behavior adoption and change.\u2022 methodologies for conducting inquiry into human behavior, collective action, societies, or cultures.\u2022 alternative theoretical frameworks which attempt to explain social phenomena.\r", "outcome": " Two key learning objectives for the course are to:  analyze the socio-cultural factors influencing human behavior and societal development.  understand and be able to distinguish the concepts and theories of sociology to appreciate alternative accounts of how social forces shape human behavior and belief.", "syllabus": "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Week\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Topics and reading\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Introduction\u00a0 \u00a0 Reading\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Chapter 1 & 2\u00a0 \u00a0 (#) \u201cThe Sociological Imagination (C.

We contrast the understanding of gender and sexuality as biological with the idea of gender and sexuality as interactive performances whose meanings are constructed in social settings. However, even though the meanings are socially constructed and variable, the consequences of these meanings are real and unequal. The chapter starts with explaining the difference between sex and gender as well as making the distinctions between the different theoretical perspectives regarding gender inequality. After reviewing the ways that gender is socialized in major institutions and how gender affects life chances, we review the different waves of feminism before introducing the topic of sexual orientation.\u00a0 \u00a0 Reading\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Chapter 12\u00a0 \u00a0 (#) \u201cThe End of Men (The Atlantic)\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 8\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Race and ethnicity\u00a0 \u00a0 This chapter introduces you to the socially constructed nature of race and ethnicity with an emphasis on the interactional aspects of both.

Following the discussion of race as an interactional accomplishment, we discuss how race and ethnicity affect life chances in health, education, income, and the criminal-justice system.\u00a0 \u00a0 Reading\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Chapter 11\u00a0 \u00a0 (#) \u201cWhat We Mean When We Say \u201cRace Is a Social Construct\u201d (The Atlantic)\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 (#) \u201cAffluent and Black, and Still Trapped by Segregation (The New York Times)\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cSeeing Mexican Immigration Clearly (Cato Unbound)\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 (#) \u201cYou\u2019re Asian, Right?

Politics and education are presented as a sociological paradox: They function at the macro level to shape everyday interactions; at the micro level, those same everyday interactions construct the social institutions. The chapter begins with a discussion of politics and the different political systems. The section on education provides a brief history of modern education before reviewing how education reproduces inequality in our society and outlining three classic studies of education that take symbolic interactionist, conflict, and structural functionalist perspectives, respectively.

We also attempt to link the macro perspective on these social institutions to the micro perspective of students\u2019 everyday lives.\u00a0 \u00a0 Reading\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Chapter 15\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cReligious Diversity May Be Making Americans Less Religious (FiveThirtyEight)\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 11\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Families and relationships\u00a0 \u00a0 This chapter introduces you to an inclusive model of families. We look at the family as a social group whose members are bound by some type of tie\u2014legal, biological, or emotional\u2014and who may or may not share a household. Family members are viewed as interdependent in their sense of mutual responsibility for each other\u2019s care. The chapter emphasizes how the social institution of family affects individual experiences in this realm and how individuals influence the institution of family.\u00a0 \u00a0 Reading\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Chapter 14\u00a0 \u00a0 (#) \u201c5 Surprising Insights of \u201cModern Romance\u201d (Futurity)\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 (#) \u201cThe M.R.S. and the Ph.D. (The New York Times)\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 12\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Deviance and crime\u00a0 \u00a0 This chapter introduces you to the socially constructed nature of deviance and conformity, with an emphasis on how definitions of deviance vary across cultures, history, and situations. We focus primarily on differential association, labeling theory, and stigma. Concepts of individual identity, social interaction, and deviance are discussed in detail. Following the discussion of the impact of deviance on identity and interaction is a brief summary of crime data.\u00a0 \u00a0 Reading\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Chapter 7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Health and illness\u00a0 \u00a0 This chapter focuses on the sociological perspective on health, illness, and medicine. Rather than casting health and illness as a biological and physical phenomenon, we use this chapter to emphasize how social factors shape health, illness, and mortality. After explaining how our bodies are social objects, we go into how disease and health are both influenced by social factors such as geography, ideology, socioeconomic status, gender, and race.\u00a0 \u00a0 Reading\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Chapter 19\u00a0 \u00a0 (#) \u201cDoes High School Determine the Rest of Your Life?

Through the exploration of selected issues in Chinese culture which are significant and relevant to everyday life, this course introduces to students historical materials which relate to, and contemporary research on, the role of gender in the making of history and culture, and how history and culture work to shape our understanding of gender. As they participate in the learning activities of the course, students will be gradually led to understand Chinese culture from a new perspective. Furthermore, students will have a chance to reflect on long-held values and beliefs which they themselves have acquired as members of this culture, or which they witness in the daily life of the community around them. While helping students to further understand the Chinese culture and history in a new gendered perspective, this course resonates with the Sustanable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by United Nations, including SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities).

From award-winning movies, heart-warming testimonies, tabloid stories to Facebook groups and social campaigns, we have been consuming, constructing, and circulating narratives of \u2018the past\u2019. This act of remembering and exploring \u2018our history\u2019 questions a mainstream Hong Kong story of success demonstrated by economic development and material wealth, and attempts to identify discontinuities, gaps and silenced voices in the dominating narrative. It has also prompted reflections on the relation between narrative and identity \u2014 personal, collective, and spatial \u2014 in historical inquiry, and in what ways the writing of history has been shaped by disparate ideals, values, web of relations and power. This course will revisit Hong Kong\u2019s history through the exploration of narratives documenting women, a group often made invisible in history writing, as social actors in the fabric of colonial Hong Kong. From elites\u2019 households to textile factories, from rural villages, western-district brothels to mid-levels convents, schools and hospitals, women of different generations have worked as caregivers, breadwinners, pioneers, and educators while contesting the prescribed subordinate status as objects of exploitation in a patriarchal society. Drawing from a wide range of sources, including archival documents, published biographies, autobiographies, memoirs, family histories, school histories, and oral histories, this course will seek to introduce a multi-faceted history of colonial Hong Kong with women as the focus of inquiry. The discussion of women\u2019s narratives will be situated in respective historical contexts linking the personal to social, political and economic changes in Hong Kong under colonial rule. It will also discuss the use of auto/biographies and oral histories as a methodology in historical research investigating the relations between memory, self and identity.The course resonates with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 by directly engaging in critical reflections that help students work towards the SDGs 5 (Gender Equality), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).", "outcome": "", "syllabus": "", "required_readings": "", "recommended_readings": ""}, {"code": "3208", "title": "Love and Intimate Relationship", "career": "Undergraduate", "units": "3.00", "grading": "Graded", "components": "LectureProjectInteractive Tutorial", "campus": "Main Campus", "academic_group": "Office of University GE", "requirements": "UGED3208 is double-coded with GDRS3004. ;Not for Gender Studies Majors; and students who have taken GDRS3004. ;Co-requisite: Any course with \u201cUGFH\u201d or \u201cUGFN\u201d as prefix", "description": "(UGED3208 is double-coded with GDRS3004.) \r This course reviews basic concepts, theories and research findings of romantic love and intimate relationship. Various aspects of romantic love and intimate relationship will be critically reviewed.

Upon the completion of the course, students should demonstrate basic understanding of structure, functions, dynamics, and development of romantic love and other interpersonal relationship. The personal is political. As personal relationships are the most basic social relationships that makes up the larger network of social relationships, it is hope that students could use knowledge from this course as an insight to understand, develop, and improve the quality of their own interpersonal relationship, and would aspire to build a more open and equal society starting from equalitarian and mindful personal relationships.
