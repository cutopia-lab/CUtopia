This course is multi-disciplinary and considers how doctors and health are presented through film, images, literature, poetry and the media, and how students can prepare in a humanistic way to meet the challenges of a career as a physician. The topic list is broad, including the physician-patient relationship, intercultural communication, stereotyping in the health professions, ideas about death and dying (as they relate to spiritual beliefs and organ donation), the pitfalls and potential of integrated medicine, the management of medical information in the media and how the Internet impacts patients and doctors, amongst other topics. Particularly, the course is designed to focus on developing students\u2019 skills in critical reading, impromptu speaking, analyzing videos and texts, and writing summaries and reflective texts. There will be one assigned reading each week and students should be prepared to present the texts to the class and/or engage in panel discussions about the texts.", "outcome": "By the end of this course, students will have further developed their skills in: Critical reading by analyzing texts in the field of Medical Humanities. Analyzing the language, expression and narrative of texts, films and images concerning the history and practice of medicine. Structuring and delivering short, impromptu presentations that emphasize professionalism, organization and English-speaking skills. Listening and critical thinking through the use of video materials, followed by tasks including summarizing, presenting or writing responses. Writing comprehensive summaries of medically related texts.", "syllabus": "Learning topics include: Writing Summaries and Critical Responses Origins and History of Medicine Medicine in the Arts and Arts as Therapy Balancing Scientific Method and Empathy Intercultural Communication in Medicine Medicine in the Media Integrated Medicine and Complementary Therapies Death and Dying", "required_readings": "Catto, G., Cork, N. & Williams, G.
